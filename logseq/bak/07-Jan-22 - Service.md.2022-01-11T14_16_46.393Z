*How am I feeling today?*
A little overwhelmed with the amount of balls in the air. Currently, the most important ones are:

- Kenneth's package

- Diagnostic stability of LPR2-LPR3
- [[Â§Log: NSSH]]
	
* Getting better at writing scientific manuscripts

* Family-talk today
* Prepping for Vestervang
