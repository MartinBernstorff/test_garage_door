* Order the right tests

## Backlinks
* [[?How do I most effectively train differential diagnosis]]
	* [[HumanDX]] scores well for [[§Generation (DDX)]] and [[§Pruning (DDX)]], but not for [[§Refinement (DDX)]] - I don’t have to come up with the tests required for further refinement.
	* [[§Refinement (DDX)]]: Checking for fit/getting more information
