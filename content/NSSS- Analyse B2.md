+ Include psychiatric diagnoses
+ For-loops to run for all exposures, both adjusted and unadjusted
+ Auto-generate a table
	+ Get information from the table in r(table)
	+ Generate an excel document via putexcel
		

Whatâ€™s missing now, then? It seems a little hard to get an overview of how each symptom relates to incidence of new diagnoses. Current alternative suggestions:
* [Dot chart](https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/graphics/gph/graphdocs/dot-chart-of-three-variables-by-categorical-variable/) 
* Range plot (geom_pointrange), grouped by category, coloured by symptom
*
