It depends on what kind of system best manages the kind of behaviour change you want to see.

If it's something frequent, a habit is definitely a good idea. Set up Habitifier for work. (Added to TaskHero).

If it's something more rare or context dependent, TAPs or WOOP may be possible, or a more formal training regimen. I don't have any specific situations right now, so it's somewhat hard to know what to do.

I think this may overemphasize habits and routines - much of what we do is also deliberate, and especially much of what we love and enjoy to do requires that we are thoughtful.

I fear that Marshall may be overgeneralizing from movement patterns to thought patterns - see Eg. [[Perhaps interleaved practice is especially effective for memorizing information with large degrees of interference? It helps find the features that separate them]].
