# NASA schedules
However, we can use the NASA schedules â€“ they roughly adhere to 6 days off a month. Timelines can be seen here: [International Space Station Timelines | NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/timelines/index.html).

On the days off, they do housekeeping and exercise. They have 8,5 hours a day for sleep.

And those are for some of the most expensive man-hours we have, with extremely well-trained individuals and only 6 month stints. They do roughly 12-hour scheduled days - 8.5 hours of work, 2.5 hours of workouts and 1 hour for lunch.

They typically have workouts both early (around 4-9 hours after wake) and late in the day (12+ hour after wake, but ends at least 2,5 hours before sleep).

Q. How is the time in a typical work-day of an ISS astronaut divided?
