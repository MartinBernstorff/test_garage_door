# How many hours should I work?
# How many projects should I take on
![The Student Work Saturation Point](https://calnewport.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/satpointchart.jpg)

There's definitely a sweet-spot, and hitting that is what we want to do to to make the most of [[§Effort]]. Because of this, hours worked is a terrible metric; easy work doesn't require effort and allows us to work crazy hours. Instead, it's regulating stress and making the most of our time that matters. 

What feedback loops can we instate, then?

Q. What might indicate it's time to scale down projects?
A. If you don't find work to be purposeful, you experience symptoms of [[Stress]], or you're struggling to meet obligations (for example, working on vacation days)

Q. What might indicate that it's time to take on more projects?
A. 1) If you frequently don't know how to improve your life, 2) Create busy-work to feel occupied or 3) Spend your leisure-time on activities that aren't particularly enjoyable, relaxing or productive.


If you're dissatisfied with what you're getting done while under low-moderate stress, the solution isn't in more hours - it's in [[§Prioritisation]] or [[Efficiency]]. After all, [[Productivity is prioritisation, efficiency and time]].

As an upper bound, you can probably see [[NASA schedules]].
