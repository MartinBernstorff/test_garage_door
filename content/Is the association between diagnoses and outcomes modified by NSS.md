# Is the association between diagnoses and outcomes modified by NSS?
Is the association between a given disease and its outcomes modified by non-specific symptoms? Eg. do children with epilepsy have more epilepsy-diagnosis contacts if they have more NSS?

This can have two explanations:

* Reported NSS are a marker of illness-behaviour, ie. that stomachache increases the perceived need for help with epilepsy

* Reported NSS are a marker of severity of disease

* Reported NSS are a marker of comorbidity
	* We can get around this by matching on all previous diagnoses
		* But we canâ€™t get around that NSS may be a marker of upcoming disease, ie. [[Pitch: Which diagnoses are the different NSS symptoms associated with?]]
