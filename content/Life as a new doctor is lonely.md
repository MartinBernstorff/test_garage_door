# Life as a new doctor is lonely
When you start work, you're going to have a lot more obligations and a lot less time to socialise. This means that having strong social circles, eg. a significant other, is going to be tremendously valuable.

It's temporary discomfort, so it shouldn't weigh heavily, but it also shouldn't be ignored.
