# Optimise constraints
Theory of Constraints argues to optimise the constraint before adding more capacity. This is because the constraint is typically capable of doing much more due to inefficiencies. 

Optimising a bottleneck is different from [[Add capacity]], namely that it gets more done with the same resources.
