# Emotional Differentiation is useful

Empirical evidence is scarce, some of it is in:
* [[Barrett 2010]]
* [[Kircanski 2012]]

Other studies that might support the hypothesis:
* Kashdan, Todd B., Lisa Feldman Barrett, and Patrick E. McKnight. 2015. “Unpacking Emotion Differentiation: Transforming Unpleasant Experience by Perceiving Distinctions in Negativity.” /Current Directions in Psychological Science/ 24 (1): 10-16.//
