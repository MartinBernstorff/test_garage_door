# Emotions are intuition that something is important
This is probably true, most of the time, given that emotions haven't been manipulated by artificial stimuli.
	* E.g. [[§Gaming]] and [[§Shallow novelty]] can stimulate [[§Wanting]] (through [[§Habituation]]?) without [[§Liking]] and [[§Approving]]). 

How, then, do we determine whether the emotions are valid? [[§Intuition]] can be validated by [[§Deliberation]] ([[Deliberate about models]]), so [[§Emotions]] can probably be validated by [[§Deliberation]] ([[Deliberate to validate emotions]]).

When emotions are not valid, e.g. when they run counter to your values and you think that's not because your values are wrong, it's time to [[Act through discomfort]].

## Backlinks
* [[Positive emotions remind us to savour what is important to us]]
	* [[§Emotions]], [[Emotions are intuition that something is important]]
* [[Align §Wanting, §Liking and §Approving]]
	* Probably large overlap with [[Align emotions and cognitions]], and largely that [[Emotions are emergent heuristics about actions for values]], [[Emotions are intuition that something is important]].
