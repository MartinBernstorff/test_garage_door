# Mieke may be poor at acting independently (mother)
My primary issue is that she tends to raise problems, without spending time or energy shaping them or considering solutions. It's basically "this smells" or "this should work" or "this didn't go like we planned", and then I take the mantle.

Some of that is my fault, I can encourage her to elaborate on the problem and consider a solution.
