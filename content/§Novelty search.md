# §Novelty search
Novelty search is the act of taking the most novel step from where you are.

This allows faster exploration of a problem space and is incredibly useful if you don't have good priors about where you want to go or how to get there.

Is well described in [[Why greatness cannot be planned]].

It works because, traiditionally, [[Novelty is a signal of information]]. However, in modern life, [[Artificial novelty distracts from true exploration]].

Q. When might novelty search never provide useful information?
A. If the information found is not valid (e.g. [[§Shallow novelty]]).

This doesn't have to be valid information about something in the "real world" – eg. abstract maths sometimes turns out to be really useful. 

But it does have to be something more than noise, eg. some of the work in the humanities hasn't yielded any fruit at all. 

## Backlinks
* [[Define the problem]]
	* Do I think that this process can improve on [[§Novelty search]] for finding interesting research problems? [[Discover interesting problems]], [[Select the right problems]].
* [[§Vision]]
	* A vision marries [[§Storytelling]] with goal-setting, and poetry with [[§Expectancy]]. It is sufficiently non-specific to not constrain action and, to some extent, allow for [[§Novelty search]], while being specific enough to be motivating and fun ([[Poetic language leaves room for interpretation]]).
* [[§Curiosity]]
	* [[§Curiosity]] solves problems in two ways, [[§Novelty search]] and helping realise a [[§Vision]]. This makes it incredibly important, while also being tremendously fun and meaningful. Therefor, it makes sense to [[Make the most of curiosity]], and one of the best ways of doing that is to [[Let curiosity guide you]].
* [[Artificial novelty distracts from true exploration]]
	* When we want to build something great, we often don't know what that is or how to get there. Then we can't do objective based search, we must do [[§Novelty search]]. However, it is severely hampered by [[Artificial novelty]], eg. news.
* [[Adjacent possible]]
	* One of the reasons that we might do [[§Novelty search]].
* [[Make the most of curiosity]]
	* [[§Int. Meandering]] - this is similar to [[§Novelty search]], and might very well be best shaped by something like [[Mailbrew]] ([[?Mailbrew is net helpful]]).
* [[§Executing well]]
	* [[§Novelty search]]: [[Avoid shallow novelty]] and pursue [[§Deep Novelty]]
* [[How do I use goals without being constricted by them? (Motivationally and good hating)]]
	* [[Don't use goals in areas with deception]] ([[§Novelty search]])
	* It circumvents goodharting by being set by yourself. You don't want it to be some long-term performance metric, something that you're incentivised to optimise towards – instead, you want it to be a milestone,like the next stepping-stone in [[§Novelty search]].
* [[Why Meander]]
	* The idea of meandering is [[§Novelty search]], looking for [[§Deep Novelty]] without a clear sense of purpose or vision. This is where I have spent large amounts of time, but how often has it been useful? 
* [[Retrieval prompts should prepare you for a future situation]]
	* What about [[§Novelty search]]? [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]], so it also makes sense to remember which steps you’ve already taken, even if they’re not directly applicable. These cards prepare you for a future decision too: Which directions to pursue. For them, the sense of [[§Deep Novelty]] is the best guide, and the [[Expert response heuristic]] helps guide their phrasing.
* [[§Playfulness]]
	* Playfulness allows us to have fun, to explore with greater width ([[§Novelty search]], wider distributions of outcomes), and probably to get more things done! 
* [[260820]]
	* However, if finding my future is somewhat like [[§Novelty search]], and [[Parenthood is hard]], [[Parenthood blocks exploration]] and therefore many potential futures.
* [[How should we critique research]]
	* It isn't always possible to know whether a result will change a decision (much research is essentially [[§Novelty search]]), but it does qualify which criticisms matter.
