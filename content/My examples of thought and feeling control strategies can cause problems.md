2. Notice the consequences of those strategies
	1. Did it solve the problem for the long term?

## Suppression
Especially when I was a kid in school. What I did was suppress my thoughts/feelings and go do things. Half-way there, so to speak – now I want to accept my thoughts/feelings, and then go do something meaningful.

## Computer games
I play computer games when I don't want to engage with Mieke and/or just when I have unpleasant thoughts about our relationship!

This means that I don't spend as much time with her, and I don't get to understand her. While effective in the short term, it is horribly ineffective in the long term. However, it may be useful until we get a regular day working and I get more data on whether I want to stay with her, [[§Do I want to stay with Mieke]].

I did have a period where I did it intensely, ie. 5-6 hours per day, so it's already cost me around 60-70 hours. It did not bring me closer to a rich, fulfilling life.

## Netflix
Exactly the same arguments can be made here.

## [[Porn]]
Another strategy for getting temporary pleasure, eg. avoiding feeling horny.

It obviously doesn't solve the problem in the long term. When it is not used in moderation it can cost me about an hour a day, and more due to the imagery being retained and taking up mental time. This can be either by distracting me during a task or during light sleep (where processing time could be spent on something more important).

Q. Think back to the last time you watched porn. How did it feel?
A. Does that make it worth the time?

Q. What might some disadvantages to porn be?
A. Decreased biological desire, time spent, increased loneliness, supports an immoral industry.

Q. Why do you think you watch porn?
A. Either because it is pleasant, or as a feeling control strategy (ACT).

It also has serious costs in vitality (since I'm not trying to connect with other humans), meaning that I interferes with getting me closer to a rich, meaningful life.

From a pure pleasure perspective, I'm not sure it's any better than using my imagination either! I'll have to explore this mindfully.
