# Do I want to try Muse for answering research questions? How do I get data out of it?
Do I want to try Muse for answering research questions?

Which role does it play? Giving a context to explore a question, easily grouping evidence and moving things around. Makes space for a more casual research process than roam, something that can be done somewhat laid back, or while loading in a game.

How do I get data out of it?
Data can be exported as PDF, text or Muse bundles. This doesn't help much with referencing though.

If I  want t, I can buy a used iPad pro and apple pencil
