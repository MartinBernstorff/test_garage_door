# Wilkinson 2020 – Reality check machine learning-powered precision medicine
Studies tend to be of poor quality, not include out-of-sample validation and note compare to health professionals.

Ie. evaluates images without giving context about the patient (presenting symptoms etc.) – this never happens in practice.

The question is not whether machine learning can predict, the question is whether it is helpful above and beyond what we have already. Much of the information is available in clinical data, which the machine learning algorithms rarely access.

Furthermore, not likely to be useful for predicting treatment response, since the models lack causality, since predictors don’t predict the counterfactual.
