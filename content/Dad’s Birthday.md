# Dad’s Birthday
What’d I like us to do? 
* Maybe a board game, e.g. Settlers?

When am I the most happy with them? When we’re not talking, but doing something else. 
 
Their talking typically is either pretty content-less (“we’re walking, eating, coffee, happy”) or statements that I don’t trust (“that is a good move because XYZ”). I’d much rather have them ask me questions, like a good advisor, or ask me questions! The advisory role (whether that be practical or emotional) is exactly what I’m looking for.
