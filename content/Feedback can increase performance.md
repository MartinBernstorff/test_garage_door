# Feedback can increase performance

## Backlinks
* [[Â§Goal Setting Theory]]
	* Some elements are only helpful, if they lead to goal-setting and commitment:
[[Incentives can increase performance]]
* [[Set proximal goals in support of distal goals]]
	* This improves performance! Much of it is through faster feedback ([[Feedback can increase performance]]).
* [[You get what you measure]]
	* So [[Measure only what matters]]. There is tension here; process goals typically don't measure what matters, they measure a necessary condition for the outcome. But process goals are the only ones with sufficiently tight feedback loops to be meaningful to measure ([[Feedback can increase performance]]).
