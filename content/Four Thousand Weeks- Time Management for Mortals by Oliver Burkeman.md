[Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks)

A book on [[§Time Management]]. 

Seems to take the meta-perspective, i.e. what is actually worth doing.

Probably has some interesting insights. Loved him on the podcast.

Has added points to:
* [[Why do we feel increasingly overwhelmed]]

* [[Should we spend more time on activities that are important to us]]
	* [[?How do we spend more time on what is important]]	
	* Can we establish feedback-loops for how we spend our time, without those becoming oppressive? Some informational feedback loops might be possible? It all depends on context, though, so the question is whether we can establish something that is more informational than simply remembering.
		* The skill we want to support is [[§Prioritisation]], but I get the sense that I’m already quite OK at that?

* [[Sacrificing freedom can itself be meaningful]]

* [[Efficiency contributes to competence (SDT) only if it’s by your own volition]]

* [[When does busyness turn to overwhelm]]

* [[§Efficiency Paradox]]
	* [[Efficiency only relieves overwhelm if the goalposts are static]]

* [[Balance ease and effort]]

* [[Focus on what you would like to do more of]]

* [[When is being idle a waste of time]]

* Productivity advice enables our addiction to endless possibilities. It allows us to maintain the illusion that we can get more done, and therefore don’t have to turn down attractive options.

* [[§Prioritisation]]
	* [[?First things first]]
	* [[Say no to moderately attractive options]]

Now he argues that if we settle, we typically become happier. However, this contradicts the coin-flipping experiment. 
Ah, but if we remove the option of changing our minds, this might make us happier with the choice (Dan Gilbert poster experiment). This isn’t really how the real world works though, is it? 

Argues that [[§Distraction]] is due to wanting to escape from discomfort, primarily from our own mortality. In this way, [[§Distraction]] is separate from mere task-switching in that it requires that the switch is to a less important task. 

This is somewhat different from [[Kurzban et al.]], which argues that we switch tasks to avoid opportunity costs, as part of an explore/exploit problem. I’m more sympathetic to the second view.
