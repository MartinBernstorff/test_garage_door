# Methods paper on reporting machine-learning in ML
Since we have so many papers of tremendously poor quality in the healthcare sector, do we want to collate those findings (and make a set of recommendations instead) that might inform reporting guidelines, like TRIPOD?

To which extent do we have something unique to add? Or can we do a "letter to the editor" instead?
