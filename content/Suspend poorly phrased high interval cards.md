# Suspend poorly phrased high interval cards
Even just for the subjective experience, you want to ensure that [[Retrieval prompts should permit only one answer]].

It’s also likely not that expensive. Cards that are highly mature are also likely more stable, better encoded to other memories ([[§Elaborative encoding]]). This means that they’re more likely to survive on their own. 
The advantage of retrieval practice is that it allows you to boost the frequency with which you have to recall a fact, reinforcing the memory quickly. 

As the interval goes above multiple years, it is so stable that you can hand off its retention to the reinforcement you get from the real world. There are exceptions, but those are when a fact is both *very rarely encountered* and *incredibly important*.

Suspending, then, might be the best trade-off between [[§Attention]] and memory. 

For implementation:
* Replace the Bear icon with a suspend button 
	* Is this possible? Can I put javascript on the cards, or was there some bug with that?
* Perhaps remove the Bear icon if the interval is high, or change its formatting in some ways? Or just suspend it?

You want to be careful you're not suspending cards just because they're difficult, though. That's [[Desirable difficulty]].

## Backlinks
* [[Prune spaced repetition systems aggressively]]
	* It’s a trade-off, though! [[Suspend poorly phrased high interval cards]]
