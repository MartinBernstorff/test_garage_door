# For a prompt with "more" response, how do I select strategy
Depends on what I mean by “more”. 

It means I want to integrate the knowledge more deeply into who I am. This opens multiple strategies, like [[Entrainment]], or repeating the prompt more frequently, or [[§Elaborative encoding]], or rephrasing the prompt.

I’ll probably have to build intuition around this. But from first principles, is there any way to know which strategy is most well-suited for the prompt?

If it’s procedural, or you want it to become procedural, [[Entrainment]], or [[Design your environment]] is the way to go.
