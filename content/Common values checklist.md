# Common values checklist
Below are some common values. (They are not the “right ones” or “best ones,” just common ones.) Please read through the list and write a letter next to each value, based on how important it is to you: V = very important, Q = quite important, and N = not so important. Of course, some values will be more important in one area of life (e.g., parenting) than in another area (e.g., work)—so this is just to get a general sense. If you wish, you can fill in one of these checklists for each major area of your life (e.g., one for work, one for relationships, etc.).
