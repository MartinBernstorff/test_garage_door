# Attention is directed by prediction errors
Eg. [[§Deep Novelty]] directs attention, since it changes our model of the world and thus means that we should adjust it – or because it means that something is weird and we need to be careful about it.

Sometimes [[§Attention]] is directed by other things, e.g. something with high expected utility, and that leads to: [[Vigilance is modulated by prediction errors]].
