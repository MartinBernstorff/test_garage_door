# Dec-21 - Home
*How am I feeling about this month?*
It’s December! Christmas! Typically a pretty good month.

Largely, this month will be about acquiring an apartment, family and friends.

For Pernille, I think getting some more events in the calendar is a good move. This means that I’ll look for them a bit.
