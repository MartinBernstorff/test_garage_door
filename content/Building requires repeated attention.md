# Building requires repeated attention
If we're to get good at [[Building]] (eg. to satisfy [[Competence (SDT)]]), we need to keep practicing it. Especially since being at the forefront of anything typically requires some degree of prior knowledge, implying that we need to [[Balance exploration and specialisation]].

If we're to develop an idea, we need to be re-exposed to it often. This requires sticking with the same thing for some period, balancing out [[Varied inputs allow for creativity]].

## Backlinks
* [[Take action on your values to live a meaningful life]]
	* The action needs to be committed, which means persistent ([[Building requires repeated attention]], [[Setbacks are not failure]]).
* [[§Effort]]
	* [[Building requires repeated attention]]
* [[Building]]
	* [[Building requires feedback]]
* [[§Stack of Possibilities]]
	* This organic decay might even outcompete monthly or whatever tags. It also further supports [[Building requires repeated attention]], without feeling forced.
* [[§General principles for optional activities]]
	* We also want a system that allows us to algorithmically [[§Guide novelty search]]. Most things are a lot more fun if you get good at them, and [[Building requires repeated attention]]. But intuition needs to be fed ([[Building requires feedback]]), and it needs to have salient options ([[Motivation is increased by salience]], [[Keep your values salient]]).
* [[How do I best handle the continuing stream of inklings]]
	* But ideas are constantly generated in a never-ending stream, so saving all and leaving none is not a viable solution. My primary issue is not enough time spent thinking, and I want to protect that time ([[Building requires repeated attention]]). [[Retention is not valuable for its own sake]] and [[Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is]], and this goes for new ideas as well.
* [[$My research system]]
	* To support [[Building requires repeated attention]]:
* [[$My thinking system]]
	* I feel like I'm not sufficiently focused on engaging with the same notes, eg. that I'm not sufficiently living by [[Building requires repeated attention]].
* [[§Principles for improving thinking]]
	* [[Building requires repeated attention]]
* [[Value effort efficiency]]
	* While [[Choosing is everything]], [[Choosing is fallible]]. [[§Determination]] comes from making a choice, but it doesn't last forever, so [[Building requires repeated attention]] ([[§Effort]]). 
* [[§Principles for improving on research]]
	* [[Building requires repeated attention]], so I want to encourage following a rabbit-hole. This allows me to [[Balance exploration and specialisation]].
* [[Notes should resurface to prompt new connections]]
	* However, a counter-argument is that [[Building requires repeated attention]].
* [[Add a special promoted tag]]
	* To amplify [[Building requires repeated attention]] and to allow specific insights to be further promoted, eg. [[Stress is challenge]].
* [[Add more emphasis on the reading and research of material connected to notes]]
	* This is to support [[Building requires repeated attention]] through [[$My reading system]] and [[$My note system]]. Currently, much of what I do is not connected to anything previous. And some of the most interesting things I have are associated with something I've selected previously, eg. the Kahnemann paper. 
* [[Add probabilistic automatic decay to incremental thinking]]
	* Allow ideas I’m working on to stay on top (especially if they’re somehow “immunised”, like adding a “working on” tag that is removed only if pressing “next”), avoiding spreading myself too thin idea-wise ([[Building requires repeated attention]], [[Balance exploration and specialisation]])
* [[Everything sucks at the beginning]]
	* That’s one of the reasons that [[Building requires repeated attention]].
* [[How do I balance ...]]
	* However, we want to [[§Guide novelty search]] since [[Building requires repeated attention]], essentially to [[Balance exploration and specialisation]].
* [[How should the personal mnemonic medium prioritise cards]]
	* Since [[Building requires repeated attention]], one way of prioritising may be to select the cards that are the least over-due. This will narrow your focus.
* [[Is a note hierarchy beneficial?]]
	* It can also help amplify [[Building requires repeated attention]], but I think my curation/promotion system does that rather effectively already.
* [[Maybe decrease step by 1 if note was edited?]]
	* This increases [[Building requires repeated attention]].
