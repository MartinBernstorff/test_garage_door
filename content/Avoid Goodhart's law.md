	* How do we measure those while still trying to [[Avoid Goodhart's law]]? Probably by evaluating whether our measurements are getting us to where we want to go, as well as bounding the desired state. [[Positive feedback]] is dangerous – we want negative feedback when exceeding desired states in either direction.
* [[§Quantification]]
	* It’s incredibly important to [[Avoid Goodhart's law]], so do your best to [[Measure only what matters]] - after all, [[You get what you measure]].
