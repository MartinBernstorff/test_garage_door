# Hobby ideas
Bias towards hobbies that are:
* Physical (to get your body moving and maintain your health)
* Social (since your job might not afford you much of this, it’s essential for having a good life and it’s not something you naturally gravitate towards)
* and have balanced genders. 

On the other hand, you also want to just have fun. That is something you can mostly figure out by feel. 

Eg. salsa.

* [[Games can give intense fun]]
	* One consideration is whether gaming improves total thriving by allowing me to have intense fun. This is probably not too far off, but it doesn't fit well with the writing on [[Hobby ideas]].
