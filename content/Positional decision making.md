# Positional decision making
Positional decision making

> Combinatorial vs. positional. The combinatorial style is characterised by a very narrow and clearly defined material goal. We tend to use this style when the objective is clearly defined. The decision making process is more about how we will achieve the goal rather than deciding on which goal to achieve. In contrast, we use the positional style when the goal is not as clearly defined. We make decisions to absorb potential risks, protect ourselves, and create an environment where itâ€™s less likely to experience the negative effects of unexpected outcomes.
Q. You're trying to achieve a goal, but no good path is available. What do you do?
A. Consider positional decision-making; can you choose another goal that is less risky or gives you more of what you want?
