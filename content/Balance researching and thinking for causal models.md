This can be somewhat offset by writing and [[Define the problem]], keeping you focused on what you need the information for.

* [[Establish a causal model]]
	* It is almost always a good idea to first [[Do your own thinking]], and if afterwards it is indicated, to research what others believe ([[Balance researching and thinking for causal models]], [[Collaboration speeds up problem solving]]).
* [[Mieke may not be great at solving problems]]
	* That's good! Seeking out help is a strength. But it works best if balanced ([[Balance researching and thinking for causal models]], [[Balance searching for and making your own solutions]]).
