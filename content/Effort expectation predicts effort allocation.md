# Effort expectation predicts effort allocation
Effort expectation carries highly into the amount of effort allocated, see [Brehm and Self](papers3://publication/doi/10.1146/annurev.ps.40.020189.000545).

This applies especially to long term tasks - setting realistic effort expectations affects strongly what output is decided on, eg. 3rd semester, paid internships, pupils during anatomy etc.
