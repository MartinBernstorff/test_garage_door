# Avoid shallow novelty
There are some modes of exploration that we can avoid because we know from prior experience that they include low levels of true novelty. 

Examples include:
* Browsing the Reddit front-page and reading the news frequently. 

This avoidance is essential; it's pruning out the noise from our life to make room for being curious about the things that truly matter.
