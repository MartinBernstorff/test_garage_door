# §My Vision for Work
Great work is work that you’re good at, that’s interesting and which makes the world a better place ([[§My Vision for a Better Future For Humanity]]).

## Detail
[[Vision for Work: Private Sector, Data-science]]

### Hospital + research/implementation
This doesn’t require anything different from the above, AFAIK. Basically just keeping an eye out and seizing opportunities. This is what I need to do, though, *seize* opportunities as they present themselves. Explore them rapidly and to their greatest possible extent. 

## Alignment
For this to be aligned with [[§My Vision for a Family]] and [[§My Vision for a Partnership]], right now that means something where I can achieve job- and circadian stability relatively quickly, while ensuring a decent to high level of income.

This might happen in the private sector with data science, [[Vision for Work: Private Sector, Data-science]].

Q. You’re invited to a social event (e.g. a party), which might have people you’re interested in meeting. You’re don’t feel completely comfortable showing up, though. What might you do?
A. Explore to the greatest extent possible! Ask explicitly whether you’d be intruding, and if not, show up and contribute as much as you can!
