# §Boredom
Boredom arises when we have a lack of meaningful goals and/or a lack of [[§Deep Novelty]].

It is unpleasant, and through that unpleasantness motivates us to [[§Curiosity]], to want to learn or seek new goals. Enduring [[§Boredom]] in itself is not a virtue, then, but to [[Handle boredom skillfully]] is.

A life with constant, artificial stimulation is like being constantly on pain-killers. It removes an important motivation.

In a world where there is still scarcity and great suffering, that is not acceptable. We need people to solve problems for the novelty that is in them!

A certain level of boredom is adaptive, then.
