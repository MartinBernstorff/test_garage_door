# A lack of effort signals a lack of growth 
This appears true on the surface since:
1. To grow, you have to challenge yourself
2. When you challenge yourself, it feels effortful

That doesn’t mean that you need effort all the time – sometimes you need to get the best out of what skills you already have. It also doesn’t mean that effort always signals growth – it might be part of [[§Resistance]] instead.
