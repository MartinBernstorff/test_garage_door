# Problem solving in teams
Advantages of collaborative problem solving:

[[Collaborative problem solving increases average solution quality]]
[[Collaboration speeds up problem solving]]
[[Collaborative increases number of problem types that can be solved]]

[[Independent problem solving increases maximum solution quality]]

[[Ability to reload a solution decreases maximum quality of solutions]]

::However, intermittent collaboration gives the benefits of all of the above.::
