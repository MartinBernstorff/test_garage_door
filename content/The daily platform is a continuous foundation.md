# The daily platform is a continuous foundation
I raise this question because I, at least sometimes, get distracted by an idea or something I'd potentially like to do, and then end up not doing the daily planning at all – e.g. researching a new monitor or similar. 

I probably want to add these small tasks to the daily plan, so that I remember them and [[Close open loops]], without getting distracted by doing the activity right now. That is one of the major advantages of [[Daily planning in a daily working log]], it is such low [[§Friction]] that you can do that without a large loss to overhead.

This means that it is advantageous to have a continuous, initial planning block (akin to laying down the foundation for the day) and then, as things change, add new activities and adapt the plan.
