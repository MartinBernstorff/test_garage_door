# 08 Dec 21 - Work
*How am I feeling today?*
A little tired, but unsure about why. Might have a small infection coming up. 

Other than that, ready to work! Want  to get LPR2-LPR3 out of the way so we can get started on the most important work, getting new models implemented! 

* LPR2-LPR3
	- Merge "Lasse" into lpr2-lpr3
	- Merge "Martin" into lpr2-lpr3
	* Re-run the results
		* Make a list of which results we're reporting 
		* Add p-values to the relevant results
			* Make p-value adjustment depend on the correct number of comparisons
	* Add to manuscript
		* Add text about new results to manuscript
		* Send to Lasse/Erik
		* Send to the entire group

* Check if there are blockers coming up for the other projects - anything else we need to get started on?

* [[Â§Pair programming]]
