# Instrumentality decreases intrinsic motivation
Since [[§Intrinsic motivation]] is one of the most enjoyable parts of life, I want to protect it with all I have. For things that are just fun, you don’t want to focus on them having to produce joy.

However, you do want to notice whether you’re actually having fun, so that you can let go of behaviours that are habituating without being enjoyable ([[Habitual and intentional behaviour are different]], [[When having clarified values, put in habits in service of those values]]) and so you can [[Savour life]]. This requires noticing without judgement.

That is a bit of a paradox.
