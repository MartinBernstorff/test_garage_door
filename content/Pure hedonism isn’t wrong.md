# Pure hedonism isn’t wrong
I get the sense that I feel like hedonism is wrong – eg. that if I imagine myself sitting with a fiction book and reading it, I discount that experience strongly. And I discount it more strongly than eg. travel.

However, this doesn’t fit my lived experience very well. I can enjoy reading a book tremendously! It is especially great in that it can allow me to relax without considering the needs of others.

But therein lies also its flaws. It doesn’t build relationships with others, it doesn’t build competence at anything. This means that, in the long term, it’s probably a poor choice for getting my basic psychological needs met. It’s something I want to do as relaxation, as a way of recuperating after a long day’s work or finishing a hard project – but it’s rarely meaningful to me in itself. Fiction books aren’t part of [[Enjoyable usefulness]]. 

However, I enjoy it a lot, and that’s important too. It’s about balancing the present with the future. 

Essentially, this is another way to [[Use heuristics for prioritisation]]. [[MIL balances stimulation and relaxation]].
