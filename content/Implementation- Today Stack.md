# Implementation: Today Stack
Some questions re: implementation:
1. Hashtags will pile up in the notes
2. If it's a stack, important things are high-risk of getting lost
	1. Use reminders with a time for these?
3. Implement a way of finding them quickly, e.g. a "bwt" or similar 

This affords me an advantage over the #home/project; it's a separate dimension, so things I'm just pondering can be added, too.

I don't know about loose errands, like "tidy rooms" - adding reminders for them seems overly rigid, but having to find them in a stack also seems... Problematic. I can let the environment serve as the reminder, though.
