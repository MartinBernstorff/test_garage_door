# S: Incremental thinking
I want something that makes it easy to get started thinking about something. It doesn’t need to have an allure or a peripheral vision, since I want it to become part of my daily routine.

The simple, MLP-style program might be a python command-line script that shows me one note at a time, with title and content, and has buttons for:
1. Open in Bear
2. Next (and increase interval)

I can get that started pretty quickly. Let’s give it a go!
