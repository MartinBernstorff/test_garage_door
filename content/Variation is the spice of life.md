# Variation is the spice of life
Variation typically leads to novelty, and novelty fosters [[§Intrinsic motivation]].

Furthermore, variation is probably beneficial for [[Basic Psychological Needs (BPN, SDT)]] satisfaction.

However, a change in life that lowers variation can be indicated if it leads to strong, meaningful experiences (and satisfaction of [[Basic Psychological Needs (BPN, SDT)]]), eg. [[§Parenthood]].
