# 18/11/2021 - Work
*How am I feeling today?*
Quite decent! A little fatigued and half-depressed in the morning, but it tends to fade away as I get started on the day. 

Quite excited about getting TimeHero up and running, that'll help with faster planning in the morning I think. 

*Today*
- Setup R linting VSCode 

- How far back can our models handle? See LogSeq

- LPR2-LPR3
	- Gør legend-tekst større
	- Gør Facet-label outline minder stærk

* Look into [[Clairvoyance: A Pipeline Toolkit for Medical Time Series | OpenReview]]

* Prep for Responsible Conduct of Research

*Eftermiddag*
* Strukturerede variable
	* Hvor mange forskellige variable får vi, hvis mindst X% skal have fået registreret variablen?
		* Blodprøver
		* Andre objektive registreringer

*Misc.*
* Nourish seedlings



*Pain points*
* Slow iteration on tables
	* Extract the df to local, then iterate there

* Moderate speed iteration on figures
	* Extract df to local, then iterate there
	* Assumes that you know which data you want to represent - worth a shot to see if that applies

* Spending time on sending the tables in outlook, then discovering mistakes. Might want to knit the table to docx instead

* Lots of time spent, unsure if worth it
	* [[Quality check at low value]]
	* Add Memory.ai for better time-usage debugging
