# A Future without Doctors
Humanity will be better off if we rely less on doctors. This is for a bunch of reasons:

* Doctors are sparse. They’re expensive to train, and that means they require large pay and are not accessible to everyone who needs them. Due to inequity in the distribution of money, this is even worse.

* The amount of knowledge that we accumulate is not well suited to fit into one mind. This means that doctors will make mistakes, because they lack knowledge.

* Doctors are human. They fall into traps like the [[Availability Heuristic]]. Computers, for the most part, do not.

How might we get there? That’s a great question, probably involving some sort of highly efficient [[§Reinforcement Learning]], maybe augmented with [[Inverse Reinforcement Learning]].

Even if we have algorithms with incredible performance for tasks like these, the public needs to trust machines to make (or augment) the decisions of doctors first. That is most likely to happen if, and only if, we demonstrate their utility in regular practice first.

This leads to where I can make a difference, [[Job-vision: Guiding Implementation of ML in the Clinic]].
