# Inboxes increase engagement by promoting context switching
How is that different from analogue? Can I remove that from Gmail, eg. by only showing unread? Or by archiving if the inbox has been opened while the item was in there, to avoid having to open every mail?

Can I use outlook for personal email so I can [[Avoid inboxes]]?
