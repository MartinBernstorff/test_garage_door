# §Intrinsic motivation
Intrinsic motivation comes across as:
Precursors: Novelty, challenge
Behaviourally: Play, exploration
Emotionally: Interest, curiosity

It requires that the activity is undertaken for its own sake.
* [[Salience of utility strangles fun]]
	* [[Focusing on utility decreases intrinsic motivation]]

But that doesn't mean that it can't end up being useful anyway!
* [[Intrinsically motivated creation is a good heuristic for a life well lived]]
	* [[Enjoyable usefulness]]

* [[Make room for intrinsic motivation]]
* [[Quantification decreases intrinsic motivation]]
* [[Challenge is intrinsically motivating]]
	* [[Some of recreation lies in challenge\/intrinsic motivation]]
		* [[Difficulty can be both good and bad]]

* [[We need challenge to enjoy life]]
	* Q. Why might challenging experiences make your life better?
* [[§Curiosity]]
	* I think [[Curiosity]] can be used as a synonym for [[§Intrinsic motivation]], but I'm not quite sure yet.
* [[Do your own thinking]]
	* It's also incredibly rewarding! Like [[Knowledge has intrinsic meaning]], [[Understanding has intrinsic meaning]]. It's allowing our [[§Intrinsic motivation]] to flourish! Or, for learning that’s at least partially in the extrinsic category, it helps integrate the motivation.
* [[MIL avoids burnout]]
	* Fun ([[§Intrinsic motivation]])
* [[Adjacent possible]]
	* This is an argument for learning for fun, eg. following [[§Intrinsic motivation]]. Unfortunately, it's not an argument for the humanities – for something to be novelty search, it still needs to provide valid information about reality. Much of the humanities is inherently biased, or doesn't relate much to reality. 
* [[§General principles for optional activities]]
	* Optional activities are typically fun and at least partially initiated by [[§Intrinsic motivation]]. This means that we want to do as many of them as feasible.
* [[§Motivation]]
	* [[§Intrinsic motivation]], (fun/pleasurable/enjoy/interesting)
* [[Understanding has intrinsic meaning]]
	* [[§Intrinsic motivation]] is the basic drive to explore and understand the world around us. It's doing things for their own sake, something many of us absolutely adore!
* [[§Recreation]]
	* Fun ([[§Intrinsic motivation]])
* [[Design systems that support valuing its actions]]
	* That protect [[§Intrinsic motivation]], 
* [[22/11/2021 - Work]]
	* Might confound my feeling of enjoying ML a bit tbh, so keep that in mind. However, I've been reading up on it in my free time, indicating [[§Intrinsic motivation]] as well. That's a really good sign.
* [[How might gaming relate to an unhelpful belief]]
	* Is it true? 
	* [[§Intrinsic motivation]]
* [[Instrumentality decreases intrinsic motivation]]
	* Since [[§Intrinsic motivation]] is one of the most enjoyable parts of life, I want to protect it with all I have. For things that are just fun, you don’t want to focus on them having to produce joy.
* [[Variation is the spice of life]]
	* Variation typically leads to novelty, and novelty fosters [[§Intrinsic motivation]].
* [[When should we explain things to others?]]
	* Eg. if others get a new toy, explaining it can take away their curiosity, their [[§Intrinsic motivation]].
