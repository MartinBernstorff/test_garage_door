* [[Action menus should be shaped by intention]]
	* By having intention be primary, I add more friction ([[Choosing requires friction]]). This is both beneficial ([[Adding friction facilitates choice]] and costly ([[Choosing is effortful]]).

	* In the sense that boundaries delineate different [[§Context]]s. For something to be an effective boundary, it must include friction. This implies that [[Friction facilitates focus]], ([[Adding friction facilitates choice]], [[Choosing requires friction]])
