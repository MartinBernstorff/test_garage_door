# Choosing the right journals determines scientific productivity
Given the log-normal distribution of impact factors, as well as [[Low agreement between reviewers on acceptance]] (eg. already accepted papers are often rejected), being ambitious (but realistic) in selection of journals makes a huge amount of sense. 

However, my experience with [[NSSM]] was that I accurately gauged the kind of journal that it fit into. This is only one datapoint, but given the time spent doing submissions, is probably an important one.

Select based on having roughly the same formatting criteria, to save time.
