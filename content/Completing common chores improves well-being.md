# Completing common chores improves well-being
Mieke tends to complete tasks that she feels are important, but which aren't commonly shared.

Sometimes she does complete commonly shared tasks, eg. making an overview of what to see in Iceland. That was awesome!

But she often does stuff like washing our towels (when I have only one dirty one), gathering flowers, re-organizing (without improving/taking my day into account) etc.
