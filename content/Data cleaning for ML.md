# Data cleaning for ML
* Work on copies of the data (keep the original dataset intact).

* Write functions for all data transformations you apply, for five reasons:
	* So you can easily prepare the data the next time you get a fresh dataset
	* So you can apply these transformations in future projects
	* To clean and prepare the test set
	* To clean and prepare new data instances once your solution is live
	* To make it easy to treat your preparation choices as hyperparameters

1. Data cleaning:
	1. Fix or remove outliers (optional).

2. Feature selection (optional):
	1. Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task.
3. Feature engineering, where appropriate:
	1. Discretize continuous features.
	2. “Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.).
	3. Add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x), sqrt(x), x2, etc.).
	4. Aggregate features into promising new features.
4. Feature scaling:
	1. Standardize or normalize features.
