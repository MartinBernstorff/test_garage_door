# Clairvoyance: Classification performing poorly?
Seems like this also outputs an array of `number of test_locations` x `max_seq_length`, where for an online problem I would expect one for each time-point in the test_set.

It also outputs the same array for each unit of prediction, which is weird! Ask Lasse.
