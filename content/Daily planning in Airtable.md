# Daily planning in Airtable
*Advantages*
1. Allows me to add notes
	1. [[Do I want to take general notes on activities during the day]]
2. If I select by matching, still seems like making a choice, rather than a to-do list
3. Can sort or filter by "completed"
4. Saves me about 100 Danish kroner every month compared to Complice

*Disadvantages*
1. Might not nudge me as much towards the *why* of an activity
	1. Testing out having a field that aggregates goals and displays them. This might be sufficient.
2. Might feel less free 
	1. When I'm selecting by "searching", that's not much of a problem
3. More friction, mainly in data entry.
4. Doesn't naturally maintain the order of completing tasks, like in Complice.
