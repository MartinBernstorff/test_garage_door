# §My Vision of My Partner
For elaborating: [Go on a date with Jacob](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmccihMOy8ExDnW3zvdRjMQ54onWuFEeozJZ0YW3TnVCobOg/viewform)

[[Which activities do I want to do regularly with a partner]]

When writing and thinking about this, keep in mind that [[It's unlikely you'll find the perfect partner]], [[A meaningful relationship contains discomfort]], and [[Emotional love is volatile]].

However, even though [[It's unlikely you'll find the perfect partner]], there are varying degrees of fit. LTRs are succesfull if they help both parties live lives true to themselves, meaning that [[LTRs need value overlap]], [[LTRs thrive with goal overlap]], [[LTRs are challenged by goal conflict]].

To set intentions for how you want to be, it makes sense to simulate it; that's where the rubber hits the road – [[A day in my ideal partnership]]

- Incorporate this into the "partner simulation"
- Incorporate [[The traffic test]]

This means that my ideal partner doesn't have wanting children as a goal.

## Very important
* [[Value curiosity]]
Ideally, we also have shared interests. For me, that's wanting to experience things (concerts and events, some degree of travel), but definitely also intellectual curiosity. This last part has become more and more important in my recent years.
	* [[I want a girlfriend I can philosophise with]]

* [[Value caring]]
My partner is sensitive to my needs, as I am sensitive to hers. This means we support each other's autonomy, we help each other build competence and skills that we'd like to build, and we support and try to understand each other's interests.

* [[§Nobility]]

[[My ideal partner is a realist]]
	[[My ideal partner isn't into religion]]
	[[My ideal partner isn't into mysticism]]

[[Romantic relationships thrive with similar intelligence]]

[[My ideal partner has fun when around me]]

[[My ideal partnership can extract fun out of unfun situations]]

[[My ideal partner is open to different ways of thinking]]

[[I want a girlfriend I can philosophise with]]

## Somewhat important
[[My ideal partner is robust]]

[[My ideal partner is a functionalist]]

[[My ideal partner doesn't want children]]

My ideal partner is sensual. She makes a conscious effort for intimacy and sex, and doesn't expect nor require that it just "happens naturally". She is not phased by changing circumstances. When she gets stressed, she looks for increasing intimacy – she doesn't isolate herself.

* [[§Do I want to stay with Mieke]]
	* This is really examining whether Mieke is a good fit for [[§My Vision of My Partner]]. [[It's unlikely you'll find the perfect partner]], so it's important that you [[Compromise on the unimportant]]. This means that you want to gauge how important the below points are, not just whether you perceive them as deficits.
* [[§Romantic Relationships]]
	* [[§My Vision of My Partner]]
* [[The ideal date]]
	* Firstly and most importantly, it needs to get us information about whether this potential partner fits us well ([[§My Vision of My Partner]]) and give them information about whether we fit them well.

	* Pernille was very  nice yesterday! It seems to her that this matters a lot, so I need to take good care of her. Part of that is figuring out [[§My Vision of My Partner]], and specifically, how Pernille fits into that. I'd regret not knowing that, and then letting her get hurt.
