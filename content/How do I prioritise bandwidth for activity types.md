# How do I prioritise bandwidth for activity types?
Most of my activities are either about "exploring" (reflecting, planning, researching) or "exploiting" (doing or experiencing). But which are most important at a given time?

When you're reflecting too much, you're not executing enough, so you're not making much progress.

What, then, indicates whether to reflect or do?

Q. What might indicate that you're reflecting too much and doing too little?
A. 1) You focus on knowledge instead of effectiveness, 2) You aren't taking risks, 3) You aren't becoming more certain as you reflect

For 3), this might indicate that you have reached the thinking satiation point ([[Acting produces information]]).

Q. What might indicate that you're doing too much and reflecting too little?
A. 1) You waste your time on things that are meaningless, 2) What you do isn't effective, 3) You repeat the same mistakes

Q. What might indicate that you’re balancing reflecting and doing well?
A. 1) You focus on what matters and 2) You're working hard while saying no to the unimportant

This is an orthogonal dimension from [[Take action on your values to live a meaningful life]], which is a direction on [[§Prioritisation]] for exploting.
