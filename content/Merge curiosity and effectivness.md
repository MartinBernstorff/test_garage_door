# Merge curiosity and effectivness
Are they fundamentally at odds? Curiosity may require meandering, being non-goal oriented, whereas effectiveness by definition requires a metric.

However, we can prune some curiosity-driven tasks by them being extremely unlikely to be effective; reading the news, playing video games etc.

This makes for a whitelist of curiosity-driven tasks which aren't goal-driven, and yet more effective than choosing at random.

This may interact with [[How do I use goals without being constricted by them? (Motivationally and good hating)]] and [[Metrics may be less problematic when you're in control of them and know the context]].
