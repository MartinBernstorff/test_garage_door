# ?Decrease lack of consistency in 12th sem. retrieval prompts
This is essential to get right soon – [[Retrieval prompts should permit only one answer]] to avoid [[Retrieval Induced Forgetting (RIFO)]].

It’d probably also make the review sessions much easier, and make it easier for me to maintain focus.

One typical failure mode is the list where I don’t recall all the elements. This needs to be fixed ASAP. I can do this by converting those lists that I fail at into cloze deletions.

[[?Use cloze-deletions to learn sets and lists]]

One point might be that the questions are too unfocused, or too arbitrary. E.g. listing the diagnoses for VITAMINS isn't really context-focused, it doesn't reflect how you'll use it in real life.
