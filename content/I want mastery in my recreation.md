# I want mastery in my recreation
I think so! It might make [[§Psychological detachment]] a little harder, but doing something challenging that I can get better at is a core part of who I am.

From a gut feeling, I'm also a little worried about it. It's a need I rarely need to satisfy more, and it might induce [[Salience of utility strangles fun]].

Many days, it'll be sufficiently satisfied by just doing my work, so it's definitely not a top priority. 

I think, in total, it's something I'll add to [[Complice.co]], but as one of the less important goals. This helps me with [[§My optional execution system]], and specifically helps add mastery as something to do during vacations.
