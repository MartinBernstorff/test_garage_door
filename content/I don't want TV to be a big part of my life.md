# I don't want TV to be a big part of my life
One of the reasons for this is that I want Mieke and I to spend quality time, or just relaxing time, together.

This begs the question, which activities are of higher quality? I enjoy reading, but that isn't very intimate and doesn't result in shared experiences. It beats reading alone, though.

It is a way of increasing the odds of my partner and I having an enjoyable life. A question arises, then: [[Do we want to remove the TV from our living room]]
