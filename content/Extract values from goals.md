# Extract values from goals
[[Turn negative goals into positive goals]]

So to get to the values underlying a goal, we can ask any or all of the following questions (preface them with this phrase, “If this goal were achieved …”):

What would you do differently?
How would you act differently?
How would you behave differently in your relationships, work life, social life, family life, and so on?
What personal qualities or strengths would it demonstrate?
What would it show that you stand for?
What would it enable you to do that is meaningful and that matters in the big picture?

If clients give you a positive goal, additional useful questions to elicit underlying values include “What’s that in the service of?” “What’s important/ meaningful about that?” “What is it that matters about achieving that goal?” “What’s important about that?” “What would having that enable you to do?” For example, the values underlying a holiday may be about being adventurous, nurturing mental health, or spending quality time with the family, and so on.
