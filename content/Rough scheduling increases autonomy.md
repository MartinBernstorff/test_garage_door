# Rough scheduling increases autonomy
See work in Roam on scheduling, Tonietto (2016?)

Rough scheduling may imply that no further action is required for the event to actually take place, so it's not an obligation.

Mentally, not having a specific time gets around a lot of time-scheduling issues, like people not wanting to start large or important tasks if they know that they have an upcoming scheduled task coming.

* [[Auto-scheduling decreases satisfaction of autonomy]]
	* Firstly, some autonomy can be re-introduced by the auto-scheduler not imposing a specific time, eg. [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]].
* [[$Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]]
	* This means that I can take advantage of [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]] and [[Auto-scheduling limits analysis paralysis]].
* [[§Executing well]]
	* [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]]
* [[Scheduling makes activities seem more like work]]
	* See Tonietto 2016. Can be at least partially circumvented by [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]].

	* [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]] - [[Complice.co]]/[[Sunsama]]
* [[Daily planning in Airtable vs a Daily Working Log]]
	* I think that'll allow for intrinsic motivation and autonomy to a greater extent (i.e. an extension of [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]]), and then I can use [[§Warroom]] as scaffolding when required – e.g. when I don't know what to use an afternoon for. 
* [[$Auto-schedulers]]
	* [[Scheduling makes activities seem more like work]], probably through [[Auto-scheduling decreases satisfaction of autonomy]]. Can be somewhat circumvented by [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]]. Rough scheduling (eg. at a day or rough section of day level) implies that I can decide not to do something or in which order to pursue activites.
* [[How does SkedPal vs. TimeHero affect my emotional response to completing tasks]]
	* [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]]
* [[Alerts for time-sensitive actions]]
	* I want to use [[§Rough scheduling]] most of the time because [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]]. 
* [[ML PhD: Project management]]
	* As such, it makes sense to visualise these. We want rough scheduling ([[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]]), to visualise dependencies/the critical path, and to move forwards together.
