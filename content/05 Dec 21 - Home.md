*How am I feeling today?*
Pretty good! Excited about the prospect of planning at different timelines! Especially since I can make a “stack” of it, which’ll might allow me this type of long-term thinking without promoting too much [[§Staleness (productivity)]].

- Ask Pernille about whether she can see herself living at Vestervang. If not, it probably doesn’t make sense to purchase it. 
	- Even if I don’t end up being with Pernille, I don’t see myself living alone in 4 years time - and if she’s not game for living there, my future partner likely isn’t either.

- [[A Stack of Possibilities]]
	- Plan this month for home
	- Plan this week for home
	- Add relevant tags to widgets on iPad

- Look for FB events for next week/month #dec-21

- Høre Pernille om, hvornår vi skal ses

* Plan at a year and decade level? Sets some weird boundaries, like approaching the end of a decade means that all new plans will be for a different time-horizon. You probably also don’t want to have decade-long plans be reflected on only once every 10 years. Instead, you can add the decade-reflection to yearly reflections.  
	* Start small, though! [[Quality check at low value]].
