# Why do I prefer Mads, Simon as friends to Christian, Emil
What does this imply for [[§My Vision of My Partner]]?

One thing may be BPNT satisfaction; Simon/Mads have been better at that. They support who I want to be, and I feel safer around them. Probably because we have opened up to each other about vulnerabilities and desires, as opposed to Emil and Christian Wiborg. 

I don’t think its a problem of relative intelligence; I thrive awesomely around others as smart as me. Eg. Nicolai, Ebbe, Astrid or Daniel Borch Ibsen.
