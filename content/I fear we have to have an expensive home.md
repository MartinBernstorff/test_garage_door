# I fear we have to have an expensive home
Most people she and I have had visit have complimented the perceived size, but she's been literally grimacing and excusing how small it is.

This means that I believe Mieke wants a spacious home.

I also believe that Mieke wants something of high quality, which will drive the price up further, moreso if it has to be close to a decently sized city.
