# ?Calendars should help you prioritise
When planning what to do in a given day, week or month, we want to select the things that lead to the life we want. 

Often, this can be divvied up into areas and activities. Work consists of writing, programming, learning, optimising. Leisure consists of friendship, romance, experiences, reading and learning etc. 

We have priorities spanning across these, and these priorities are different depending on the time-frame. We might want a system that makes clear how we’re spending our time – but only if our intuition is not good enough. Is it not? I’m unsure.
