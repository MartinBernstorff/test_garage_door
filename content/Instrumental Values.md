# Instrumental Values

## Backlinks
* [[Â§Scheduling for a single agent]]
	* [[Priority inheritance]] - if a task is low-priority, but required for a higher-importance task to get done, it should inherit the importance of that task. E.g. if you need to clean your room to have your friends over, cleaning your room becomes high priority! This is essentially what we mean when something is instrumental ([[Instrumental Values]]).
