# Balance WIP
We want to minimise work in progress for many reasons:
* [[Minimising WIP increases efficiency]]
* [[Balancing WIP increases joy]]

It is essentially about [[Balance context switching]].

But there are some areas where having WIP = 1 is a bad idea, especially when:
* An incubation effect is relevant
* Its important to signal busyness (rather than productivity)
* Psychologically it’s nice to hedge one’s bets
* Serendipitous connections (creativity) are highly rewarded

A good coinage for this might be slow motion multitasking. Uninterrupted attention for minutes and hours, but task-switching across the days and weeks.

In general, you also want exploration in your life, see [[Balance exploration and specialisation]].

Q. What might indicate that WIP is too high?
A. You have a hard time focusing

Q. What might indicate that WIP is too low?
A. Projects that would otherwise be fun seem boring

Q. Under which circumstances might WIP > 1 be beneficial?
A. Hedging bets, creativity (serendipity/incubation), novelty or signalling busyness

Q. What is a coinage for the kind of multitasking you love?
A. Slow motion multitasking

Q. What might we mean by "slow motion task-switching"?
A. Uninterrupted attention for minutes and hours, but task-switching across the days and weeks.

* [[Decrease lag time]]
	* It also is strongly interconnected with [[Balance WIP]].

	* [[Balance WIP]] is similar to this.
* [[Minimise waste]]
	* [[Balance WIP]]
* [[Principles should be bounded]]
	* Eg. for [[Balance WIP]], WIP is too high if you have a hard time focusing.
* [[Minimise inventory]]
	* The idea is to avoid [[Carrying costs]]. For knowledge work, this applies primarily to work in process ([[Balance WIP]]), as we have little or no carrying costs from work that isn't started or work that is finished.
* [[§My researcher work routine]]
	* [[Balance WIP]]
* [[?First things first]]
	* Fits poorly with [[Balance WIP]], in that it makes it hard to [[Minimise multitasking]]. At least at the level of days – you could decide to spend whole days on the part of your life that are most important to you. This’ll increase [[§Staleness (productivity)]] and obligation, though :-(
* [[Do we want synchronous or asynchronous communication for research ideas?]]
	* [[Balance WIP]], you don’t have the half-finished always-on sense you get from notifications
* [[Indicators for managing knowledge work]]
	* The idea is to ensure that there is stuff to work on (eg. a buffer), while keeping to [[Balance WIP]].
