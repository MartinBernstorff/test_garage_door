# Support QA prompts
Definitely possible, but will require some work!
* Allow the card onbject to take a model_type
	* Generate different models from config depending on type
* Detect whether next line is a Q. prompt
	* ##### TX: If so, start front/back flow

		* ##### TX: : Add new field each time an "A." or "Q." shows up

	* 
* ##### TX: : Probably the switch for (two?) newlines used from [[Support lists]]


* ##### TX: : Exclude A. and Q. from context in clozes (probably not required, since I'm processing at a paragraph level)

## Backlinks
* [[$My Personal Mnemonic Medium (instance)]]
	* [[Support QA prompts]]
