Do I want to do life lessons thinking in the morning?

It changes the probability I'll spend mornings with Mieke, which is something that she likes a lot.

It'll also make my mind pre-occupied with lots of ideas from my personal life, which may make it harder for me to focus at work.

However, I'll find it exciting, making it easier to get up.

I also have a flexible workplace, so I can milestone my ideas before I leave them.
