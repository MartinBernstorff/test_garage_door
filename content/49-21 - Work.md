# 49-21 - Work
* [[§Diagnosestabilitet på tværs af LPR2->LPR3]]
	* Work hard on getting a draft out this week
		* Get the final results done
		* Send out to the full group

* Check if there are blockers coming up for the other projects - anything else we need to get started on?





*Pain points*
* bhc and bwc match on each other - maybe I should prepend work and home, to avoid the match? Doesn't work. Any other way of avoiding the matching?
	* Perhaps use dd-mm-yy - Work/Home

* Each run of the code takes a long time. How can I save some of it?

## Backlinks
