# I have more distractions when at home
#### Define the problem
This is in large part due to Mieke moving around. I avoid a large part of this through earplugs and headphones.

The visual dimension I currently am slightly annoyed about.

Also the pain in my ears from wearing headphones for some duration.

#### Shape a strategy
This can be further improved by rotating the layout, so that Mieke going back and forth doesn’t mean that she’s going around me. 

Get in-ear headphones that are comfortable under hearing protection

Another solution is to work somewhere else.
