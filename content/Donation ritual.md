Add something like: this pledge is a way for me to pass on some of the good fortune and tremendous help Iâ€™ve received.

> I recognise that, as feeling beings, we are all the same. We desire well-being and dislike suffering.
> 
> I promise to remember this, and to use this knowledge to spur me towards greater achievement.
> 
> I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant amount of good, and that I need a relatively small income to live well.
> 
> Therefor, I will give at least five percent of what I earn to whichever organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others, now and in the years to come.
> 
> I make this pledge freely, lovingly, and sincerely.
