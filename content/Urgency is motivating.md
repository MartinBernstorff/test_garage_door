# Urgency is motivating
Urgency is the sense that we need to get started. When we're at the inflection point where we believe our actions matter most, eg. at the point where we might fail if we don't get started, that's when we're the most motivated.

One way of doing this at a global scale is to [[Nudge towards being more aware of time?]].
