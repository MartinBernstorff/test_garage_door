# When do we generate predictions for CVD
We might generate them the day before a planned visit to hospital (whether that visit is somatic or psychiatric).

This means that the total number of predictions will be higher for patients with a higher number of hospital contacts, and thus that performance metrics will be largely affected by those.

I think that’s OK. It reflects performance in a clinically relevant way, which is what we’re looking to do.

If we want to do it the day before, then we can only do it for planned visits – not for acute admissions. 

We can also do it the day after, but that limits somewhat; we can still contact the GP or the patient directly for follow-up based on the prediction, but it is much easier to intervene when the patient is already there.
