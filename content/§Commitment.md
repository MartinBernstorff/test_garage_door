# §Commitment
Commitment is saying "I'll stick with this", and following through.

When and for how long to commit depends largely on our best guess at the current causal model ([[Establish a causal model]]) and available alternatives. However, since [[We can’t make perfect decisions]], we need to [[Use heuristics for prioritisation]].

<!-- #p1 When should we commit? -->

It is advantageous in that:
* [[Commitment increases stability]], and
	* [[Motivational intensity is increased by probability of the goal outcomes]]
		* [[Committing to others makes them commit to you]]

* [[Commitment makes you finish]]
	* [[Finishing increases gains]]

However, commitment also tends to be like debt, it can accrue interest:
* [[Commitment increases risk of regret]]
	* [[Commitment makes you less flexible]]

[[What might indicate insufficient commitment?]]

<!-- #p1 -->
---
Q. Why might commitment increase risk of regret?
A. It makes you less flexible, increasing the risk that you'll miss something important.

Q. Why might commitment improve relationships?
A. [[Commitment increases stability]], stability is required for vulnerability and building a shared future

## Backlinks
* [[Make status quo minimal effort]]
	* This isn't always desirable – we want the upsides of [[§Commitment]]. But be aware that committing has costs, and commit when it is indicated.
