# Meeting with Max, 30/11/2020
Introductions

How do we estimate the value of exploring unknown unknowns? Eg. the transistor and the computer.

I’m thinking it may be somewhat of an explore/exploit problem, but I don’t know quite how to define the constraints. The things is, I can in principle create my own option. 

Potentially:
* Meeting other epi-EAs
* [[Do I want to do more about inoculation against misinformation project?]]

Reference: 
* [[What am I looking for in a PhD]]
