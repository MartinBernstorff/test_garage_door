# Writing and thinking on mobile
My instinct is that I want to be able to access my inbox when on mobile.

However, which consequences might this bring?

I'm worried that it'll impede on my ability to relax. Always being able to bring up an interesting question to ponder may make it seem like an obligation to do so, especially if pondering important questions is part of my job (eg. research).

On the other hand, it can definitely make life more interesting. Having access to interesting problems means that you're more likely to work on them, and working on interesting problems is a core part of the life that I want to have.
