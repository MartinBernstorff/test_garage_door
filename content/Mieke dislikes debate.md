# Mieke dislikes debate
It means that I am unsure about what she believes, and that means that I am less certain about who she is.

On the other hand, almost every time we have to make a practical decision, we end up in agreement. I think part of the reason for that is that I think things through to a greater extent than she does, she knows and respects this, so she leans on my view quite often.

She might also lean on my view because it feels unpleasant to disagree with me ([[Make debates a safe space]]) – I'll have to ask her about that, and ask her how we can make that better. 

This might imply that I will be carrying more of the intellectual load when we are making decisions. It also means that our relationship is less like a partnership. However, that is one of the inherent strengths of being on team. You complement each other. The question is then, how does Mieke complement me?
