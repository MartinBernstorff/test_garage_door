# Activity coach
The point is to get into a reflective state, so I can integrate motivations and turn them into action. Part of that is adding ratings to each activity, so those ratings can propagate to the activity menu. 

However, having to rate each activity individually feels like a chore, often moving me out of a reflective state. While this gives me granular information for each activity, it is not valid as a measure of time well spent.

I want to reflect at the highest point of leverage. That is rarely at the level of each individual activity, but rather at the level of a day. A day is well spent if it fits its context.

Sometimes I do have information on individual activities, and I want to either highly promote or highly demote those. 

To implement, I will write the entire day and let that propagate to each activity. I might want to make it possible to override the rating of a given activity.
