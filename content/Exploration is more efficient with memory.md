# Exploration is more efficient with memory
Explorers need maps! If you don't know where you've been, you don't know how to avoid walking in circles so you need to [[Remember what you've explored]] – it implies that you want to add notes not only for the information you find useful, but also some for the arguments you've discarded. This is one of the main benefits of the [[$Personal Mnemonic Medium]].

Q. How does the [[§The Personal Mnemonic Medium (general concept)]] help exploration?
A. It allows you memory of which stepping stones you've already been on.

## Backlinks
* [[§Guide novelty search]]
	* [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]]
* [[Consume collected information quickly]]
	* This limits overhead from collecting material on paths that you don't want to explore, or collecting material with large overlap ([[Curate inflow of information]], [[Quality check at low value]], [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]]).
* [[Retrieval prompts should prepare you for a future situation]]
	* What about [[§Novelty search]]? [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]], so it also makes sense to remember which steps you’ve already taken, even if they’re not directly applicable. These cards prepare you for a future decision too: Which directions to pursue. For them, the sense of [[§Deep Novelty]] is the best guide, and the [[Expert response heuristic]] helps guide their phrasing.
	* Q. What is a counter-argument to “you should only add cards to Anki if they directly solve a future problem”?
* [[Ability to reload a solution decreases maximum quality of solutions]]
	* This collides with [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]] – can I reconcile that difference?
* [[Exploration is about learning]]
	* It also means that [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]], because you can learn faster if you don’t have to relearn things.
* [[Writing aids memory]]
