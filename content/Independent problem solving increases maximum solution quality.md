# Independent problem solving increases maximum solution quality
Due to more time spent exploring the problem space.

One example: You want to avoid sharing ideas in a brainstorming process until after some idea generation has taken place, see 20 from [[Bernstein 2018]].

For areas where we only have poor solutions, this implies that you may want to work independently to avoid local optima.
