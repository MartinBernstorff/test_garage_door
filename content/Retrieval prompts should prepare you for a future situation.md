# Retrieval prompts should prepare you for a future situation
This touches upon one of the more basic questions regarding [[§Memory]] and [[§Memorization]] – why do we have memory in the first place? Roughly, it’s so that we can save computation and avoid making the mistakes of others – but see [[§Memory]] for more.

In this sense, this prompt is true. Cards are most powerful when they’re shaped so that they empower your future self This means that [[?Retrieval prompts should include (only) the context available at usage time]].

If they need to maintain maximum flexibility, [[Memorising detailed facts allows for flexibility at usage time]].

What about [[§Novelty search]]? [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]], so it also makes sense to remember which steps you’ve already taken, even if they’re not directly applicable. These cards prepare you for a future decision too: Which directions to pursue. For them, the sense of [[§Deep Novelty]] is the best guide, and the [[Expert response heuristic]] helps guide their phrasing.

Q. What is a counter-argument to “you should only add cards to Anki if they directly solve a future problem”?
A. [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]], so also add cards if they’re interesting! ([[§Deep Novelty]])

Q. How might you gauge whether you have written a sufficient number of prompts capturing a new idea’s [[§Deep Novelty]]?
A. [[Student Heuristic]] - can you get the gist of the idea from the cards (and linked concepts) alone?

Q. How might we gauge whether a retrieval prompt written for its [[§Deep Novelty]] is phrased sufficiently precisely?
A. [[Expert response heuristic]]; will an expert be able to answer it consistently?
