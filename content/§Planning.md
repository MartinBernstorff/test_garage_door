# §Planning
What separates [[Planning]] and [[§Prioritisation]]?

One downside is [[§Staleness (productivity)]].

Planning has a bunch of other advantages like:
* Allowing you to simulate the consequences of your actions, so you can skip the ones that aren’t important (also required for [[§Prioritisation]]).
	* [[§Estimation (time management)]]

* [[Decrease dependencies]]

* [[Optimise the critical chain]]
