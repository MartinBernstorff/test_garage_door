# §Memory
* [[Memory saves computation time]]
	* [[Use heuristics]]
* [[Memory allows us to avoid the mistakes of others]]
* [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]]

* [[Declarative memory allows model-based learning]]
* [[Model-free learning doesn’t require declarative memory]]

## Backlinks
* [[Retrieval prompts should prepare you for a future situation]]
	* This touches upon one of the more basic questions regarding [[§Memory]] and [[§Memorization]] – why do we have memory in the first place? Roughly, it’s so that we can save computation and avoid making the mistakes of others – but see [[§Memory]] for more.
