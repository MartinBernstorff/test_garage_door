# Optimise for the long run
Life is a marathon, not a sprint, so make sure that your systems support this.

Otherwise, you may run the error of Taylorism; improvements in the short term, but injury and fatigue in the long term.

Q. Why might you want to give less than 100% effort?
A. Life is a marathon, not a sprint

Q. When might it make sense to give it your all?
A. If sprinting gives outsized benefits, and there’s room for recuperation afterwards.

Q. What might the negative consequences of 100% effort be?
A. Injury, lack of slack when new opportunities arise.

Q. What feedback structures tempt us to give 100% effort?
A. Signals effort (short term positive feedback), fatigue only in the long term (negative feedback).

<!-- #p1 How does this fit with [[How Emotions are Made]]? -->

What does this imply for [[§My execution system]]? Probably that I don’t want to maximise time spent at all. Rather, I want to keep it steady around a given level, and to change it up and down depending on how I feel. I want to [[Align emotions and cognitions]], and use that to adjust time spent.
