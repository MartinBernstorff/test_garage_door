For today, I only have about one hour. This means that ideation is probably the most important.

I'd like to do some work on the idea on a temporary promotion stack, eg. when a note goes from p3 to p4, add the 'promoted' hash tag to it for one cycle. This allows for spacing of ideation, ie. [[Nudge towards repeated effort in ideation]]. We can do this for reading as well, eg. r1 etc.
