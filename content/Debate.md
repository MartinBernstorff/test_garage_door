# Debate
How do proponents of personalised medicine suggest that its implementation will:
* [[Improve treatment decisions]]
* [[Enhance our knowledge of human biology]]
* [[Lead to more efficiency and economic benefits?]]
* [[Improve effectiveness of public health measures, prevention and early detection?]]
* [[Avoid unnecessary treatments and treatment side effects?]]

* If treatment response can be predicted from n factors, then we can avoid wasting treatment on those who do not benefit
	* [[Improve treatment decisions]]
	* [[Enhance our knowledge of human biology]]
	* [[Lead to more efficiency and economic benefits?]]
	* [[Avoid unnecessary treatments and treatment side effects?]]

* We can identify novel drug pathways from genomics
	* [[Enhance our knowledge of human biology]]
	* [[Lead to more efficiency and economic benefits?]]

* We can reclassify diseases, leading to easier research on treatment options (if aetiology -> treatment)
	* [[Improve treatment decisions]]
	* [[Enhance our knowledge of human biology]]
	* [[Lead to more efficiency and economic benefits?]]
	* [[Improve effectiveness of public health measures, prevention and early detection?]]
	* [[Avoid unnecessary treatments and treatment side effects?]]

For this to happen, though, we can first estimate whether there is in fact a pattern in how people respond to medication. Does response at time t predict response at t1? And if treatment canâ€™t be given more than once, are there factors associated with response that are externally valid.
