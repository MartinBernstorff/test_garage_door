# Do I want to implement an Evergreen-like system (like Andy Matuschak's)
Why?
I think it could be helpful for developing my understanding of more complicated problems. Concrete examples would be:

1. Exploring whether I want to work on functional somatic symptoms
	1. Do I believe they're a discrete diagnostic entity?
		1. Deliverable: Which criteria do I think it should satisfy? Also research whether
	2. Do I believe that there's potential for good work there?
		1. Deliverable: Ideas for specific studies
2. What do I believe to be important

In more general terms, Roam is not prompting me to develop ideas as much as I'd hoped. For hard conceptual work, where pruning dead ends is just as important as being creative, writing in full sentences intuitively seems more helpful than an outliner.

For now, doing it as a 1-hour activity each morning seems like a great way of experimenting with it. I can then re-evaluate whether it actually brought me the kind of satisfaction that I expected.

# Necessary features:
- A way of adding notes on mobile

[[Writing and thinking on mobile]]

Most likely possible, all it requires is syncing my notes to Dropbox and getting a decent markdown editor for my iPhone/iPad.

- Something to ensure retention, probably some kind of spaced repetition

- I'm awaiting Andy's reply.

Alternatives are
1. Using Neuracache, but then I would have to maintain both Anki and Neuracache.
2. Manually adding to Anki. Harder, but doable.

- Very quick way of adding notes on desktop

Probably possible via a global hotkey and using the hotkey for the daily note.

# Roam vs. Obsidian
## Full text editor
I'm trying out using a full editor, rather than an outliner, as it seems to make me think more clearly. I think it makes me more likely to condense and synthesize my thoughts, rather than ramble on.

This may be a disadvantage when being purely creative, it depends on my balance between generation and critique.

## Reference management
Using Roam for reference management seems useful given their in-line back-linking feature, specifically for each figure in the document. However, it may be possible here â€“ all I'd have to do is create a file for each document, then link to the hypothesis right under the figure. For example, see [[Bonvanie 2017]].

It doesn't give me contextual back-links though.

How do I ensure retention?
