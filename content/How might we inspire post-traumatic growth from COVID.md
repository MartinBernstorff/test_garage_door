# How might we inspire post-traumatic growth from COVID?
One thing we might learn is that, when the going gets tough, having people to rely on is what makes life worth living. Not (necessarily) because we need something *from* them, but because we need to be *with* them.

This might inspire us to build more and closer relationships.

Another is that we have shown that we are stronger than we thought. We have persevered through a tough period, all of us together, and we have come out the other side.
