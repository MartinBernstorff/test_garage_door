# When do I want to select new projects
I want to select projects just a bit before I get a sufficient amount of free bandwidth. This ties into [[Â§My High-Level Vision for My Life]], specifically [[MIL contains interesting problems]], balanced with [[MIL balances stimulation and relaxation]].

I won't always have the desire to get new projects going, but that's definitely a modifiable factor. I want to avoid [[Amotivation]],  that ties into [[How do I select new projects]].

It's also a [[Just in time (JIT)]] vs. [[JIC]] situation.

Also matters with motivation, both [[Motivational Intensity]], [[OIT]] and, to a lesser extent, [[GCT]].
