I’m starting to lean towards parenthood. I think I could be a decent father, and I’d probably prefer great partner + children over decent partner without children.

Also, the amount of time I have available right now is on the high side. I’d love to fill some of that with a wife, and maybe even children.

Whether this is prompted by Simone Veis Marxen, or a true belief, isn’t clear to me yet.
