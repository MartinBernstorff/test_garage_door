# Learning and performing compete
[[On Learning]], [[On Teaching]]

In the sense that you have to show and spend as much time as possible on your weaknesses to learn, but you have to avoid and hide weaknesses to perform.

Performing is about plucking the low hanging fruit, learning is getting better at climbing the tree.

Performing is about getting as many tasks done as possible. Learning is about struggling with the tasks you're not good at.
