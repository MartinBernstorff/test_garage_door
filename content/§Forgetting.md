# §Forgetting
* Forgetting improves inference
	* [[Forgetting removes noise from our models]]
	* [[§Forgetting helps compression of information]]
		* [[Forgetting prevents overfitting]]
	* [[Forgetting combats distribution shift]]

* Forgetting makes memory more efficient
	* [[Forgetting may be useful in increasing search speed]]
		* [[Size of set is inversely proportional to lookup speed]]

* There are different types of forgetting (Davis, Neuron 2017)
	* Interference induced forgetting
	* Motivated/intentional forgetting
	* Retrieval induced forgetting (retrieving one part of a memory suppresses others)

[[What does information in §Forgetting imply about memory]]

Does anything I've learned on forgetting imply stuff for Anki practice? Right now, I think I want to [[Use heuristics]], and I can support that by memorising models.

	* [[§Forgetting]]
* [[Do I want to suspend Anki cards when they rise above a certain interval]]
	* E.g. because the purpose of [[§Forgetting]] is that [[§Forgetting helps compression of information]].
* [[Might knowing many broad concepts overload our brain with inputs]]
	* Might this be another argument for [[§Forgetting]], especially in the frame of general rules?
