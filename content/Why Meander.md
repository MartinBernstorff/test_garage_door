# Why Meander
The idea of meandering is [[§Novelty search]], looking for [[§Deep Novelty]] without a clear sense of purpose or vision. This is where I have spent large amounts of time, but how often has it been useful? 

Moderately rarely; it has lead me to some of the things I treasure most, such as [[§Effective Altruism]] and programming. On the other hand, those have been driven in very large part by the reading that should accompany the meandering.
