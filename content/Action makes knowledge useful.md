* [[Use practice as the bar for truth]]
	* How, then, do we apply this? Well, use [[Believe-ability]] to [[Filter feedback]]. And take action on much of what you learn. Not only does it give you feedback, also [[Action makes knowledge useful]]. 
	* Q. Why might we [[§Guide novelty search]] to those things we can soon apply?
* [[Turn knowledge into behaviour]]
	* [[Action makes knowledge useful]], so we want the knowledge that we acquire to be turned into behaviour that improves our lives.
* [[The personal mnemonic medium programs attention]]
	* The [[§The Personal Mnemonic Medium (general concept)]] is a great way of implementing that. It allows you to [[Do your own thinking]], and when you reach tentative conclusions, to easily entrain those into action ([[Action makes knowledge useful]]).
* [[Remember second and third order effects]]
	* That's both how we go from insight to action ([[Action makes knowledge useful]]), and a good way of coming up with novel insight.
* [[§The Personal mnemonic medium (general concept)]]
	* What is the point of this? Essentially, it allows us to stop running in circles. It stores your conclusions in memory so you don't have to come to the same realisations over and over again ([[Maximize reuseability]]). It also allows you to keep that knowledge salient, so that it can inform action. After all, [[Action makes knowledge useful]].
