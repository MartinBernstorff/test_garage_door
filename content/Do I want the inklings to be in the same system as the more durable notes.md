Do I want the inklings to be in the same system as the more durable notes?

I'm afraid this will drown out the more durable notes, making them harder to find. One alternative is to delete notes of less than x characters which aren't linked to and don't link to anything. But that's hard to program.

Another is to keep the inklings in a separate folder, but that increases the risk of me not seeing them, and makes it harder to make 1Writer links to notes.
