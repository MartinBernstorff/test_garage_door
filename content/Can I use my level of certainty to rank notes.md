# Can I use my level of certainty to rank notes
This marries [[Peripheral vision (design)]] with a [[§Stack of Possibilities]]. The problem I’m trying to solve is combining different types of notes.

Another question is, why am I not more drawn to examining the [[§Stack of Possibilities]]? Typically, when I do so, I’m delighted at what I find! 

It might require too much of a choice; what type of activity am I looking for right now? A solution to this is to combine them, using e.g. #p2 for something you're moderately certain you'll want to engage with in the future, and lower numbers for higher priorities.
