# Can we predict time to incident diabetes
Training a regressor rather than a classifier.

* How do we code negative controls? Infinity/-1?
* Or maybe hierarchical models? E.g. 
	* First, “will develop diabetes”. If yes, predict time to diabetes.

Maybe we can do this as an instance of [[Multitask learning]]?

* [[§PhD: Implementation of T2D prediction]]
	* For T2D, this means as early as possible. For feasibility, since we have 1-9 years of follow-up, we probably can’t do more than 2-3 years.
