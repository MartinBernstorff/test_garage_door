How does this reflect on [[§Psychological detachment]]? Does it imply anything for when I have to work from home now? Does it change [[Home is lack of intention]]?

Argues that we don’t need hard boundaries, we just need [[§Psychological detachment]] through an analogy to farmers. I’m unsure about the truth in this, as the work of farmers is tangible, so there are times where they aren’t buffered. This is not how the life of the knowledge worker is.

Another argument is that work/life balance is a false dichotomy, which leads us to expect that:
* Work has to suck, so we don’t try to change it

> Any workplace can provide:
	* 	Fulfillment and Challenge
	* 	Working on something bigger than yourself
	* 	Coworkers that can be turned into Friends.

* Work and life are always trade-offs. But the truth is that if you feel good at work, you feel good at home, and vice versa.
