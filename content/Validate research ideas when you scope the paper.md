# Validate research ideas when you scope the paper
Should we [[Probe the research problem]] and [[Probe the research approach]] during [[Shape research ideas]], or during [[Scope the paper]]?

On the one hand, you want to [[Quality check at low value]] to discard output at its lowest value stage, so you don't spend time doing eg. [[Scope the paper]] with ideas that don't work.
 
On the other, many of your research ideas will never be pitched as a paper ([[JIT vs. JIC]]). 

I think the conclusion is to do it when either you're considering pitching an idea, or when you want to.
