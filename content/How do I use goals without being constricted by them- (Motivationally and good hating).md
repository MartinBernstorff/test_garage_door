# How do I use goals without being constricted by them? (Motivationally and good hating)
Inspired by [[§ACT]], I'm considering using goals to increase my performance on the things that matter most to me.

I'm exploring what is known around goal-setting ([[§Goal Setting Theory]]), to explore which problems may arise and how I can circumvent them.

My major concerns are:
1. [[Avoid Goodhart's law]]
2. [[Don't use goals in areas with deception]] ([[§Novelty search]])
3. [[Spend your time on what is important]]

---

It circumvents goodharting by being set by yourself. You don't want it to be some long-term performance metric, something that you're incentivised to optimise towards – instead, you want it to be a milestone,like the next stepping-stone in [[§Novelty search]].

This means that you get the benefits from [[§Goal Setting Theory]], while avoiding some of the drawbacks.

Specifically, you'll avoid much of the inflexibility (since you re-orient periodically) and the goodharting (since you set meaningful goals).

However, these goals are much harder to set!

This is something akin to [[Agile]].
