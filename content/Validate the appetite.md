# Validate the appetite
It’s tremendously valuable to consider “how much is this idea worth” rather than how long it will take to solve. Rather than starting with a strategy and ending with a number, you start with a number and end with a strategy.

It also makes it easier to scope the solution - there’s always going to be a better solution. The question is what you can get done within your appetite. What is nice to have, but can be saved for later?

This is practically [[Fixed time, variable scope]] from [[Shape up]].

	* Probably not really. It's just an interesting phenomenon in how I [[Shape the strategy]] and [[Do the work]]. Insight is an input, but it's rarely the full solution – and I can get insight into problems that are not worth solving, ie. where when I [[Validate the appetite]], it doesn't fit.
