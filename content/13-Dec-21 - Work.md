# 13-Dec-21 - Work
*How am I feeling today?*
Quite good! A little tired after sleeping with Pernille, but some things are worth the fatigue. Can separate the two beds in the future, when sleep becomes increasingly more important. 

* GruppemÃ¸de
	* Prep for this
		* LPR2-3 - new version available ASAP

* [[LPR2->LPR3]]
	* Setup bookdown and do a run
	* Ensure that p-values are added

* Chat with Helene and Jacob

* Write into LPR2-LPR3 manuscript describing new results (add the p-values to the text)

* Journal club
