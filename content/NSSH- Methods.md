# NSSH: Methods
R1: Why adjust for sociodemographics and previous morbidity?

R1: Why exclude twins and triplets?

R1: How do you define somatic and psychiatric complaints?

R1: Somatic and psychiatric hospital settings? 

R1: What is total risk time? 
R2: P2: Lines 16-17 – please elaborate on this statement “Time spent emigrated or admitted to hospital was 
subtracted from total risk time “. Also, what does risk time mean?

R2P3: Line 6 – the sentence is missing some words (see capitalized words): “Since previous studies have shown 
that the frequency categories surrounding “more than once a month” AND “NEARLY EVERY MONTH” are very similar to participants, and to maintain comparability, we merged “more than once a month” and “nearly every month”

R1: Why was the HBSC-SCL modified? In particular, why leave out back pain? 
R2: “Furthermore, the backache item in the original questionnaire was not collected.” Why, especially in the light of the discussion page 9, lines 3-9?

R2P3: Line 19 – you introduce the term “somatic” to refer to medical/physical (vs psychological psychiatric). Can 
you clarify this at this point in the paper, since the definition of your term does not come until page 4 (lines 
10-16)? This suggestion comes in the light of the somatoform/somatic terminology in psychiatry, especially 
around multiple health complaints, as it has a different connotation than in this paper. 

R2P3: Line 20, remove “a” before “psychological”

R2P4: Line 8 – replace “mental” with psychiatric?

R2P4: Lines 11-16 – is it imperative to list out all the ICD10 diagnostic codes? It gets overwhelming for the reader (see general comment #1)

R2P4: Line 20 – you introduce the Charlson Comorbidity Index – can you provide more information about the 
instrument, especially with regards to the values you report in Table 1 and 2?

R2P4: Line 24 – Statistics Denmark – is it the same as reference 22 from line 9? Please remember that the readers 
are not all familiar with Danish institutions and systems/abbreviations (also see general comment #1)

R2P4: Line 14 – “ISCED97” – what is that? Spell it out? (see general comment #1)

R2P4: Line 18 – “(2,4,17,26)” – what does this mean?

R1: How does removing a symptom and changing the scale affect psychometrics? 

R1: The discussion around merging the frequency categories is very confusing and without clear rationale 

R1: The description of the HBSC should be reorganized with clearer 
description of the measure (see comments above): How were the somatic and psychological dimensions defined? 

R1: Why were the specific comorbidity diagnoses chosen? 

R1: Why describe these if they were not used and only the CCI was used?Please supply more information on the CCI and psychometrics since it was a primary covariate. How was this gathered? 

R1: Why did you choose those paternal variables? 

R1: What is the Akaike Information Criterion (please cite)? 

R1: How was statistical significance determined? 
R2: With regards to the differences you report in the result section of the paper (e.g. between MHC and non-MHC groups, within the MHC groups, and the report of “exponential relationship between HBSC-SCL 
sum score and number of hospital contacts”) are they statistically significant? Are you reflecting these differences and using the terms with statistical back-up or just based on observation or statistical significance: e.g. “participants being more likely to be girls (52.3% vs. 45.3%)”?
