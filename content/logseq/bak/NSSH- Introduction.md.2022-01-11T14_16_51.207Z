# NSSH: Introduction
R1: 1st paragraph w/description of the measure seems like it should go 
either later in the intro or in the measures section. It sends the message that the focus is on the measure, when its really on MHC. It’d be better for the introduction to focus on the problem rather than the measure. I would rework the intro. 

R2: You mention literature that reflects on the association between “Non-specific health complaints in this age 
and increase healthcare contacts” (lines 13-14), yet you state “To the best of our knowledge, no study has examined whether MHC predict healthcare contacts” (lines 20-21).

R2: Line 19 – please spell out GP

R2: Line 20 – what does “multiple exposure definitions” mean?
