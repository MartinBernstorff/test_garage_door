# Turn negative goals into positive goals
If clients give us a negative goal—something that they don’t want—we can often quickly transform it into a positive one by asking “What do you want instead?” For example, if the client says, “I want to stop fighting with my mom,” we can ask, “So what would you like to do instead? How would you like to be when you spend time with her?”
