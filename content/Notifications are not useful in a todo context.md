# Notifications are not useful in a todo context
Notifications are about reminding you to do something.

If you have time to get something done, you're going to be looking at your lists.

If you don't, the notification isn't going to get you anywhere, since you're just going to ignore it.

This means that the notification essentially doesn't do anything useful.

Instead, [[Todos should be reviewed and turned into short-term plans]]
