# §Expectancy

## Backlinks
* [[§Vision]]
	* A vision marries [[§Storytelling]] with goal-setting, and poetry with [[§Expectancy]]. It is sufficiently non-specific to not constrain action and, to some extent, allow for [[§Novelty search]], while being specific enough to be motivating and fun ([[Poetic language leaves room for interpretation]]).
	* Q. How might a vision be better than specific goal-setting?
* [[§Hope]]
	* Hope arises when we have a [[§Vision]] of a better world and we can see a path towards it ([[§Expectancy]], [[§Motivation]]).
