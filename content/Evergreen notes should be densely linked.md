# Evergreen notes should be densely linked
One reason for this is [[§Elaborative encoding]]. Linking notes densely means that we get in the habit of relating what we're writing about to what we already know. This improves retention.

It also makes us more creative. Applying known methods to new problems is one of the main ways that innovation happens, whether that be in entrepreneurship or academic research.

Notes that can't link anywhere are also staggeringly likely to never be used again. If a though doesn't relate to anything, it's unlikely to affect anything.

	* It means that notes might disappear; if they're not linking to any note, and they're not linked to, they're highly unlikely to ever resurface. This may not be a problem, it may even be useful: meaningful thoughts are never pure orphans, see [[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]
