# How do I go from goal to activity to tried activity in TWS
The current issue is that new activities will show up every day, and I don't know how to only make them show up sometimes without linking that to the rating they have randomly assigned.

Okay, I've solved that! Now the activities are randomly shuffled, don't cluster, and are shuffled every hour. This is perfect!
