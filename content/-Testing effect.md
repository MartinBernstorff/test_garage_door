# $Testing effect
Interference in recall, small effects:

> In sum, although various types of recall interference are quite real (and quite interesting) phenomena, we do not believe that they compromise the notion of test-enhanced learning. At worst, interference of this sort might dampen positive testing effects somewhat. However, the positive effects of testing are often so large that in most circumstances they will overwhelm the relatively modest interference effects.

## Backlinks
* [[§Spaced Repetition (primarily use Retrieval Practice)]]
	* A spaced repetition practice is the combination of the [[$Testing effect]] and the [[§Spacing effect]].
* [[Retrieval prompts should ensure reviewers must retrieve answers from memory]]
	* This is since the prompt depends on the [[$Testing effect]].
