* My parents offering me unconditional love
* A girlfriend who is understanding, even when I'm difficult
* Close friendships (Simon/Mads), and plentiful social life
* Opportunities and the means to improve my life, e.g. intellect, finances, social circle in Aarhus
* I'm grateful for living in a country where I can become a doctor without debt, while living a good life! DK is awesome.
