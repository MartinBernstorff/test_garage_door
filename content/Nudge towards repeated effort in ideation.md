# Nudge towards repeated effort in ideation
It's the balance between allowing older notes to perservere, while keeping newer notes at the surface. A temporary #p method for this is definitely great, especially if a p can be reset if the note is modified.

To keep pinned notes at the top, touch them every time you launch Obsidian. Every time they're touched, increment the pN counter until it reaches X. When so, add to a prompt folder, remove the pX, and then it can be randomly promoted from there, going through the cycle again.

This makes it essentially a stack, where the top of the stack receives the most attention.

	* Because new notes often sprout from a branch, they are a sort of repeated effort. I want to promote this. [[Nudge towards repeated effort in ideation]]

	* I'd like to do some work on the idea on a temporary promotion stack, eg. when a note goes from p3 to p4, add the 'promoted' hash tag to it for one cycle. This allows for spacing of ideation, ie. [[Nudge towards repeated effort in ideation]]. We can do this for reading as well, eg. r1 etc.
