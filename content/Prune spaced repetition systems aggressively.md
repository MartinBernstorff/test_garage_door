# Prune spaced repetition systems aggressively
This helps empower your sessions, keeping them relevant! [[?How many prompts should I write]].

It’s a trade-off, though! [[Suspend poorly phrased high interval cards]]

One question is: How can we make this as easy as possible? This is one downside to [[$My Personal Mnemonic Medium (instance)]]; opening a note and finding the card is slightly tedious as compared to pressing one button in Anki.

I can make this slightly less tedious by:
* Highlighting the text in the opened window in some way
	* Making a Keyboard Maestro shortcut for “press find in file -> paste in contents of clipboard -> Press enter to find it”
* Copying the cards prompt to clipboard, allowing for easy search 

Ideally, we want this to become a smooth part of doing the reviews. Or, barring that, we want it to be easy to suspend cards and, ideally, for those cards to be marked in the source material so we can correct it if we encounter it in the future. Alternatively, we might just suspend the cards and, if we’re in a situation where we needed the memory in the future, we’ll look up the material and rephrase the cards – whether they were suspended or not. 

When encountering a card that you’re ambiguous about, then, it’s a relatively easy process!
* Do you still care about the card? 
	* If yes, rephrase it. 
	* If no, suspend it.

	* It stands in the way of effective mobile review - [[Prune spaced repetition systems aggressively]] is easy with 'suspend', but refinement is much harder.
