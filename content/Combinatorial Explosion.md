	* Heuristics are required, because algorithms run into [[Combinatorial Explosion]].
	* Since there are infinite potential consequences of every action ([[Butterfly Effect]]), to avoid [[Combinatorial Explosion]], [[Relevance Realisation]] requires us to ignore information *without checking it*. Otherwise, all your time will be spent on the checking, youâ€™ll essentially be [[Thrashing (scheduling)]].
