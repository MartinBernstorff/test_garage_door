# 8-Dec-2021 - Review
Feeling okay about today. The major issue was running down [[§Rabbit Holes (attention)]], especially when using my computer in the sofa.

Solving this primarily has to do with avoiding the computer when at home, I think. 

There are very few things that I need (or want) to get done at home which require it. Most productive things on the computer I’d much prefer to get done in a different context ([[How can I use context to embody intention]], [[Intention as context]]).

Are there ways in which I can facilitate this? If going full hard-mode, I could leave the computer at work. This is probably an interesting experiment to run. It does cause some problems with watching tv-series with Pernille, but I think that’s tolerable. It’s a little painful, though, for example if wanting to do calculations about apartment, or when doing browsing. I might keep it in the bag for as long as possible as an alternative.

Q. You’re lying in bed. Before going to sleep, you want to…
A. Write down your reflections on the day.
