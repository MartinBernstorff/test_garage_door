*How do I feel today?*
Pretty good! On top of most things, nothing much to change, also getting better at offloading information to my notes. This is amazing. Especially for stuff that fills up your head, and which your DMN probably wants to ruminate on to memorise, you can just outsource it to your notes.

Looking forward to seeing Pernille a ton! This should be really good.
