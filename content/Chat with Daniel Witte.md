1) Diabetes and other comorbidities, need for differential treatment? Register based whether prognosis is different. Ie. is depression an effect modifier on the complication rate in Diabetes, and how much of this is mediated through HbA1C

2) Diabetes risk-factor, trans-generational effects and early-life. Bereavement/death of sibling and risk of diabetes in later life.

3) Luke’s project on using AI to combine datasets – ie. inferring missing data in dataset A from the data in dataset B, generating huge datasets. Or generating datasets that are similar to DSTs so you can share them (like thispersonisnotreal)
