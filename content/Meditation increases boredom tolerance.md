# Meditation increases boredom tolerance
[[§Mindfulness]]/[[§Meditation]] both increase tolerance for [[§Boredom]]. This can be problematic in that it reduces its adaptive effects; finding new goals, moving to a situation where you learn more etc.

But it can also be adaptive, if you have high [[Boredom proneness]]. Then it can allow you to, for example, stay with a situation for longer.
