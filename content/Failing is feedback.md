# Failing is feedback
When something you do doesn't succeed, that is tremendously useful feedback. If you take the time to work out what might've happened, it can reveal useful information.

Q. Imagine that something you care about has just failed. How do you make the most of the situation?
A. Failure is feedback; you can diagnose what went wrong and try to learn from it. Ideally, you want to also make a plan for how to avoid it happening again.
