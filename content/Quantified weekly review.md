# Quantified weekly review
I’m strongly considering a weekly review with quantified information, to maintain certain standards and to pre-commit to behaviours. This is since I have relatively large freedom, but I fear that in the last month I’ve been optimising towards happiness in the moment, rather than happiness and satisfaction in the coming week/month. In the long term, this won’t fly – it’ll give me tons of problems.

Why do I think that is? Probably because [[Most activities are poorly designed for motivational intensity]]. I’m solving part of that with Complice, but some activities aren’t a goal, rather, they’re a process where I want to maintain a certain minimum level (eg. workouts/health). For this, quantification is probably pretty good.

In my ideal world, I want to review as little as possible. This means something like spaced repetition – if a factor is under control, review it less and less frequently. I’m not sure I can implement that without too much work, so it is not part of an MVP. Also, be sure to [[Keep feedback informational]].

For now, try a super quick MVP (ie. tracking workouts) and see how it goes.

This has been replaced with [[Beeminder]], which fulfilled "[[Do sufficient maintenance]]".
