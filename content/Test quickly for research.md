# Test quickly for research
Sometimes I have a new graph or something where there are obvious flaws that I canâ€™t see. In those cases, I want to test super quickly, eg. get Bodil to look at it. 

Another problem I face is getting the quick feedback I'd like in a way that doesn't distract co-authors too much; eg. does this graph look good, anything missing? Is that really a problem though?

One idea would be very quick votes that you can complete on your phone, and/or attach a comment or two to.

However, [[Writing makes for clearer understanding]], both in the writer and the reader. Don't expect this first oral presentation to be the end of the process; and it may not even be worth the coordination effort. Does this actually save enough time to be useful?
