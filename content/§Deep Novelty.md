# §Deep Novelty
As opposed to [[§Shallow novelty]].

The qualia of Deep Novelty is 1) Surprise; it signals that the situation has something to teach, because it doesn't fit our model or 2) Puzzlement; that our model has high uncertainty, but we expect that the uncertainty can be reduced. 

For more, see [[The Alignment Problem]] cp. 6.

It's useful because it separates the noise ([[False Novelty]]) from the signal, it allows us to focus on discovering levers for change and minimising uncertainty.

Q. What is deeply novel?
A. Something that changes your model of the world.

Q. How might [[§Deep Novelty]] lead to superior well-being compared to [[§Shallow novelty]]?
A. [[§Deep Novelty]] elevates wellbeing for longer, and it can give you more leverage through [[Competence (SDT)]].

	* Q. How might [[§Deep Novelty]] lead to superior well-being compared to [[§Shallow novelty]]?
* [[§Shallow novelty]]
	* However, in modern life, [[§Deep Novelty]] is where we want to spend our attention. This highlights one of  [[§Shallow novelty]]'s most detrimental effects; it keeps us from a meaningful life containing [[§Deep Novelty]].

* [[§Boredom]]
	* Boredom arises when we have a lack of meaningful goals and/or a lack of [[§Deep Novelty]].
* [[Protect attention]]
	* [[Get bored]] to cultivate [[§Curiosity]], and then use that curiosity on [[§Deep Novelty]] rather than [[§Shallow novelty]]. 
* [[§Guide novelty search]]
	* When exploring, you want to increase the [[§Deep Novelty]]-to-noise ratio. This can be done in many ways, some thoughts: [[Increase novelty-to-noise ratio]].
* [[Note down why you marked something as readable]]
	* Or, if you need to interrogate your gut further, is this likely to provide [[§Deep Novelty]] or help manifest a [[§Vision]]? These questions are strongly aligned with what matters to you.
* [[Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is]]
	* As such, using [[§Regret Minimisation]], possibly with intuition for [[§Deep Novelty]] or manifesting a [[§Vision]].
* [[Let curiosity guide you]]
	* Whether we generate insights and [[§Deep Novelty]] is not only determined by the algorithmic efficiency off our procedures, but to a large extent also by the state of mind we’re in when we do the work. 
* [[Get bored]]
	* Q. How might boredom help you lead a satisfying life?
* [[Prioritise reading over meandering when the material is good]]
	* Q. How might you prioritise between reading and meandering?
* [[Guiding exploration is necessary due to infinite paths]]
	* [[Heuristics increase speed of decision making]].  In a sense, you can say that choosing the right exploration heuristics is a great idea, because it increases the [[§Deep Novelty]]-to-noise ratio.
* [[Let go of disputes]]
	* You want to first evaluate whether the dispute is for good reason, ie. if it may bring [[§Deep Novelty]]. If not, let it go.
* [[§Executing well]]
	* [[§Novelty search]]: [[Avoid shallow novelty]] and pursue [[§Deep Novelty]]
	* Q. How do I gauge whether to do an activity?
* [[Handle boredom skillfully]]
	* If idle, to seek out activities that give you [[§Deep Novelty]], which help you adapt to the future, which are aligned with your [[§Vision]]. As opposed to having a default of swiping facebook on your phone. 
* [[§Int. Directed Search]]
	* After all, [[§Deep Novelty]] is rare and not attention-grabbing, so it is even rarer when doing directed search.
* [[?Mailbrew is net helpful]]
	* Mailbrew helps shape my exploration towards [[§Deep Novelty]]
* [[Savour life alone]]
	* Just like fries can be salty and fatty, so can facebook feel social and have tremendous novelty. However, it doesn't actually provide us with [[§Deep Novelty]], nor does it satisfy our need for [[Relatedness (SDT)]]. 
* [[We are never bored of deep novelty]]
	* This is unlikely for [[§Deep Novelty]], except if we have non-novel things to learn that are highly important
* [[Why Meander]]
	* The idea of meandering is [[§Novelty search]], looking for [[§Deep Novelty]] without a clear sense of purpose or vision. This is where I have spent large amounts of time, but how often has it been useful? 
* [[Retrieval prompts should prepare you for a future situation]]
	* What about [[§Novelty search]]? [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]], so it also makes sense to remember which steps you’ve already taken, even if they’re not directly applicable. These cards prepare you for a future decision too: Which directions to pursue. For them, the sense of [[§Deep Novelty]] is the best guide, and the [[Expert response heuristic]] helps guide their phrasing.
	* Q. What is a counter-argument to “you should only add cards to Anki if they directly solve a future problem”?
	* Q. How might you gauge whether you have written a sufficient number of prompts capturing a new idea’s [[§Deep Novelty]]?
	* Q. How might we gauge whether a retrieval prompt written for its [[§Deep Novelty]] is phrased sufficiently precisely?
* [[Exploration is about learning]]
	* Not in the sense of memorising facts and teaching yourself skills, but in the sense of treading novel ground. This means doing things that provide [[§Deep Novelty]].
* [[Attention is directed by prediction errors]]
	* Eg. [[§Deep Novelty]] directs attention, since it changes our model of the world and thus means that we should adjust it – or because it means that something is weird and we need to be careful about it.
* [[09/10/2021]]
	* I feel on fire today, turned on, energised. I want to pursue [[§Deep Novelty]], I’m buzzing!
