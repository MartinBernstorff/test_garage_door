Absolutely in love with her. We had a chat about how I might [[I feel worse than when I was single]], and she suggested very caring things that I know she'd dislike, like having fewer dinners together.

Focus was completely on me - eg. when I said I feel responsible for her when she was home, she suggested that might help me with [[Value caring]] - it's not just draining energy, it's being a good person!

I felt very loved then.
