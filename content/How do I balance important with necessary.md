# How do I balance important with necessary
Anything that is truly necessary has to be completed. This only leaves room for prioritising when, not if, to complete it.

It often has to be completed within an acceptable delay, so how much time to devote to necessary tasks depends on what tasks are in the queue, and what the acceptable delay is.

This further implies that you want to avoid making tasks necessary if they aren't truly that. It decreases your flexibility!

Q. How do you choose between important and necessary tasks?
A. Necessary tasks have to be completed; when to complete them depends on the minimum acceptable delay and the planned completion time.

All other time is best spent on what you find to be most important. Often, that is what I'm curious about.
