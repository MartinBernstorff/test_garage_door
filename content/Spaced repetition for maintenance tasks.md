# Spaced repetition for maintenance tasks
Periodically get tasks showing up, push a hotkey and it's added to the day.

Tasks show up more frequently, the further away from their ideal time they are.

This works best for recurring tasks, as they are easier to program, but can potentially be added through Todoist.
