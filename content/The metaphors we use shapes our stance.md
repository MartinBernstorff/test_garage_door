# The metaphors we use shapes our stance
[[Poetic language leaves room for interpretation]]

Eg. 'Time as money' highlights the scarcity and tradeabiity of time, but hides intrinsic worth and flowing nature.

Or 'Argument as battle' hides the cooperative elements of arguments.

Any areas where I might reshape my use of words?
