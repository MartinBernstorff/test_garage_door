# Proportional control in guiding time
May we want proportional feedback? Eg. “Hours as compared to goal” (± X), or “Exponentially decaying weighed average hours from X days as compared to goal”?

What challenge am I trying to solve? I’m trying to make sure that I have sufficient buffer in energy and effort available so that, when crises inevitably arise, I don’t have to run up against burnout. This means that I want to quantify how much buffer I have available, to provide proportional negative feedback in how much effort and time I expend.

I probably can’t relate to a raw time number, so instead, I may want “allowed hours pr. day over the next 7 days”, or “total buffer days”. I also want the buffer to auto-ratchet, so I don’t save up ridiculous amounts of buffer (that’s probably not how stress works).

Do we want to monitor "buffer" as well?

Using the Beeminder goal as input.
