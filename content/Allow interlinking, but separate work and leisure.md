# Allow interlinking, but separate work and leisure
[[$My note system]]

When processing ideas, they tend to sprout a lot of new ideas that sprout new notes. These notes aren’t “complete” per se, and I’d like to have them as a browsable list so that I can iterate on them. So far, this is accomplished by an “Inbox” folder as my default new note location.

To facilitate [[§Psychological detachment]] while allowing interlinking and development of concepts that are highly useful in both contexts.

One way of getting around that could be to keep a synced copy of each vault in the other vault via rsync/Chronosync/Hazels sync function #stint ## ==TX==
* I may want to setup as well in md extractor, to allow for some research to take bandwidth in both domains ## ==TX==
* Exclude the .obsidian folders from the sync ## ==TX==
* That fixes backlinking as well.
* It may run some interference with my current Hazel rules, but that should easily be fixed by disabling recurrency.
* I want the sync to run LLSC -> Life Lessons when in a work context, and WLSC -> Work lessons when in a life context ## ==TX==

Nested vaults are not a good solution.
> The devs do not endorse nested vaults. There can be issues when files are renamed or moved and links not properly updating. This is especially true if you have notes with the same name.
> Beyond that, I’ll echo the benefit of using one vault. Obsidian’s search and filter capabilities are already very good with operators to search by folder, by tag, etc. Some expected future features are graph filtering and embeddable search, which allow you to see search results in more useful ways.
