# §Effort
By effort, I mean the emotional state of doing something that’s difficult. That is separate from resistance ([[§Resistance]]), which is essentially lack of meaning/progress.

[[Can I separate effort and resistance in the moment?]]

My major question is what stance to take to effort; effort can signal difficulty, and [[Difficulty can be both good and bad]]. I like effortlessness, but it’s not feasible for breaking new ground and acquiring new skills.

*Mechanics* 
* [[Effort is like a mana pool]]

* [[High quality feedback increases effort]]
* [[Goal setting increases effort]]
	* [[Effort expectation predicts effort allocation]]

* [[Building requires repeated attention]]
	* [[Difficulty can be both good and bad]]
		* [[Flow can make difficulty effortless]]
			* [[Value effort efficiency]]
	* [[Optimise for the long run]]
		* [[Design systems that value effortlessness]]
		* [[Make status quo minimal effort]]
	* [[Prioritisation should be minimal effort]]

*Emotions*
* [[Effort can be enjoyable]]
	* [[Effort is costly, but valued]]

* [[Effortlessness]]

* [[Lower effort is better in some circumstances]]

## Backlinks
* [[§Determination]]
	* Determination is the act of choosing that something is important, and therefore persisting through difficulty ([[§Difficulty]]), in spite of effort ([[§Effort]]).
* [[§Difficulty]]
	* It is often accompanied by a feeling of effort ([[§Effort]]) and, given the circumstances, can result in resistance to the task ([[§Resistance]]).
* [[When am I working hard enough?]]
	* That means that there will be cases where I don’t desire working, and where I'll work anyway ([[§Determination]], [[§Effort]], [[§Resistance]]).
* [[Value effort efficiency]]
	* While [[Choosing is everything]], [[Choosing is fallible]]. [[§Determination]] comes from making a choice, but it doesn't last forever, so [[Building requires repeated attention]] ([[§Effort]]). 
* [[How many hours should I work?]]
	* There's definitely a sweet-spot, and hitting that is what we want to do to to make the most of [[§Effort]]. Because of this, hours worked is a terrible metric; easy work doesn't require effort and allows us to work crazy hours. Instead, it's regulating stress and making the most of our time that matters. 
* [[Caring emotionally might be necessary]]
	* On a surface level, this has tension with [[§ACT]]. ACT argues that that [[Emotions are volatile]], at least in the moment, so they aren’t terribly helpful. However, taking action, and especially [[§Effort]] is much easier to apply if you feel like it’s the right thing to do. 
* [[How is effort compatible with enjoyable usefulness]]
	* [[§Effort]], [[Enjoyable usefulness]].
* [[Purposeful activities don't need to be pleasant]]
	* Q. Why don't purposeful activities need to be pleasant?
* [[What is my stance on duty?]]
	* These are often activities that we want to undertake; they're not duties in the "chore" sense of the word, but in the "doing what's important because it's the right thing to do" sense of the word. It makes me want to expend [[§Effort]] without [[§Resistance]].
