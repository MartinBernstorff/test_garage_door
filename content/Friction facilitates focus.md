# Friction facilitates focus
A large amount of salient options incur overhead because of their implied opportunity cost ([[Kurzban et al.]]).

Adding friction to task-switching makes us less likely to switch tasks, amplifying our [[§Focus]]. 

Some examples:
	* Remove google from Alfred
	* Remove Safari from phone
	* Remove email from phone

This is one of the reasons that [[Focus is fundamental (coinage)]].

It also unlocks different mental states like [[Quiet (mental state)]], where our patience is open and we’re better at deliberating.
