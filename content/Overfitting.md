# Overfitting
Q. Which factors might cause a model to overfit in ML?
A. 1) Too complex a model or 2) Too many features pr. training example

Q. In ML, how do we examine a model for overfitting?
A. Performance on test data

Q. A model in ML performs well on the training data, but poorly on the test data. What would we call this?
A. Overfitting

Q. What does “the problem of high variance” translate to in ML?
A. Overfitting

Q. How might we fix overfitting in ML?
A. 1) Simplify the model/[[Regularisation]], 2) Gather more training data, 3) Reduce errors in the training data
