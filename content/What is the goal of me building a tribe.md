# What is the goal of me building a tribe
# Build a tribe
The goals are manifold, but reduce to me being able to live a life according to my values, specifically:

* [[Value caring]], [[A tribe cares about you]]
* Network effects mean that you gain the advantages of others having explored an area ([[Explore or Exploit problem]], [[A tribe shares the fruits of exploration]], [[I value exploring ideas]])
* [[Have fun with others]]

More specifically, it means having people that care about me and that I care about.
