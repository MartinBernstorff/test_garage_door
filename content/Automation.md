# Automation
<!-- #Technology -->

My relationship with technology is, like most relationships, one with ups and downs. Technology provides great benefit, but also great distraction. Distraction is to be understood in the most negative sense of the word, removing me from what matters most.

However, technology is not one uniform entity and it is therefore useful to contemplate it in its parts.

## Automation
Automation is meant to make your life more comfortable, shave off time and be fun. These are the three parameters that each project must live up to, before you start doing them.

However, because I find home automation to be cool it can also lure me into spending *way* too much time on optimization for the sake of optimization, rather than a for the sake of improving my life or the lives of others.

Therefore, a set of criteria are useful for evaluating each part of home automation.

*Efficiency*: First of all, give a guesstimate on whether actually automating the task will save you time:

*Comfort*: Consider whether automating the task will improve comfort, or whether it'll simply be "neat".

*Fun*: Will automating the task be fun? Will it take you down paths that you enjoy treading? Will it lead to you learning new, awesome things?

### The Bottom Line

> Keep it simple, stupidâ€“ Kelly Johhnson
In general, simple ideas are stable, they will make for more fun and they will make your life better. Often, the simple problems are the ones you encounter every day.
