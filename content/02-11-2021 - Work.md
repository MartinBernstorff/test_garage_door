*How am I feeling today?*
Re: Pernille, getting really affectionate with her! Only 2 concerns; don't want to become a platonic friend (unlikely based on the type of kissing right now), and a tiny bit worried that our sexual needs differ. This last part is something it makes sense to talk about at some point, especially if we're not getting sexual soon.

For work, just very excited! A great future appears to lie ahead, especially if I sharpen my data science skills. This fits very well with my overall vision for life.

*Agenda*
- Øve præsentation 

- Setup work calendar -> iCloud sync

* Nourish seedlings

* (R: Arbejde på FeasibilityMapper)

* Mini-symposium

* Få [[Deidentificering]] på Sandbjerg-agendaen

*Lasse*
* Man kan debugge en interactive session! Se [[Jupyter Notebooks]]
	* Det er dog, i sig selv, ret buggy 🤷‍♂️ 
	* Har lavet en bug-report
* Og man kan debugge en ren Jupyter Notebook!
