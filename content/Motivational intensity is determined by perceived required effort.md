# Motivational intensity is determined by perceived required effort
### Expected Effort vs Applied Effort
Effort expectation carries highly into the amount of effort allocated, see [Brehm and Self](papers3://publication/doi/10.1146/annurev.ps.40.020189.000545).

This applies especially to long term tasks - setting realistic effort expectations affects strongly what output is decided on, eg. 3rd semester, paid internships, pupils during anatomy etc.

Since our world is far from ideal, this probably means that [[Life should be effortful]].
