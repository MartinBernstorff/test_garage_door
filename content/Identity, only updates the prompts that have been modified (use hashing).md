# Identity, only updates the prompts that have been modified (use hashing)
Currently, notes are identified by their GUID, which is generated from deckname, basename and file_index.

But I want to update and re-schedule only the cloze prompts that have been changed. This probably means that I'll need a note for each cloze deletion.
