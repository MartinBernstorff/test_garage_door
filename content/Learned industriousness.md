	* What happens if effort is expended towards something that doesn't pay off, or that you find out wasn't meaningful to you? Probably your brain remembers, and it makes it more likely to resist expending effort â€“ eg. by increasing the salience of effort in the future. The opposite is likely to hold, too. If the effort is perceived as being worthwhile (eg. seen as meaningful, useful or leading to enjoyable outcomes), you're probably more likely to want to expend effort in the future. This fits with [[Learned industriousness]]. 
	* Q. How might expending effort affect the effort pool?
Regen rate: If rewarded, [[Learned industriousness]]. If not, the reverse.
	* Q. When might preserving effort decrease future available effort?
	* Q. What does [[Learned industriousness]] mean?
* [[A lack of effort signals a lack of growth]]
	* Q. What might be negative effects of not expending effort?
* [[Should we monitor effort]]
	* [[Effort is like a mana pool]], in that it takes time to regenerate, but the mana-pool can expand through [[Learned industriousness]]. This means that we want to apply effort on most days to maintain or grow the mana-pool. This habit can be bolstered by giving it a feedback-loop, like reflecting on it daily. E.g. "did you expend an appropriate amount of effort yesterday?".
