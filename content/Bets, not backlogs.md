# Bets, not backlogs
Important ideas come back to you, and your motivation is higher for them if theyâ€™ve come up organically. Either because you remember them, or because someone k It makes sense not to force yourself to do all sorts of tracking with them.

## Backlinks
* [[Why do we prototype?]]
	* This means that we want to generate prototypes quickly, so we can learn about the idea. It also means that we can generate more ideas pr. unit time, meaning that we can have more ideas ready when we go to the betting table ([[Bets, not backlogs]]). Then we can choose between more options, hopefully finding something better.
