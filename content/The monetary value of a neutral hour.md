# The monetary value of a neutral hour
The monetary value of your time is your take-home pay divided by the neutral-hour cost of working. E.g. if it takes 4 hours for you to recuperate after an 8 hour day, it's 12 neutral hours. Your value of your time is then roughly 100 DKK/Nh.

This can help you do cost/benefit calculations when trading money for time, time for energy, or energy for money. 

E.g. you can pay money for recuperation; to sleep better, have a drink etc. if it saves you neutral hours equal to 100 DKK/Nh.

The value of your time might be even higher if you have "neutral" activities that you value a lot more than the pay you get â€“ e.g. if your work is worth much more to you than the pay, or if an additional hour increases your future earning prospectives.
