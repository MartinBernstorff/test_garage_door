Project(s)::
Introduction
Data
Study sample
Any in- or outpatient visit by patients aged 18 to 39 between Jan 1st 2011 and Dec 31st 2012 with an FX diagnosis code.
Only Sweden-born patients
Split grouped by patient - as we expect to
Prediction time
Date of outpatient visit or
Date of inpatient discharge
Predictors
Solely from Swedish registers as well as medical records
Demographics (sex, age)
SES
EMR
Visit planned/unplanned
In- or outpatient
Diagnoses
Self-harm
Methods for self-harm
Dispensed medications
Criminality
Violent and nonviolent offenses
Family history
Disease
Crime
Which medications did they use?

Outcomes:
Composite endpoint:
Suicide attempt or death at 30 days and 90 day
^^Makes it pretty hard to intervene, no?^^
Suicide attempt
Unplanned visit with intentional self-harm (ICD-10: X60-X84)
ICD-10 diagnoserne adskiller selvskade og selvmordsforsøg, e.g.
X601 Selvmordsforsøg m. ikke-opioidt analgetikum o.l. før kontakt vs.
X602 Selvskade med ikke-opioidt analgetikum o.l. før kontakt
Self-harm of undetermined intent (ICD-10: Y10-Y34)
Suicide
Death with cause as one of the above
Within 30 days following a visit
^^Overvægter de patienter med mange besøg?^^
^^How many times can the same patient be counted? Many!^^
What is the bias-variance trade-off?
Results:
Best model was an ensemble of:
Elastic-net penalised log reg
Random forest
Gradient boosting
Neural network
Finder de ikke bare, at dem med tidligere self-harm har høj risiko for self-harm i fremtiden?
When the candidate predictors were restricted to sex, age at the visit, and those identified from the National Patient Register as well as the Prescribed Drug Register (S1 Table), the AUCs for predicting the outcome events within 90 and 30 days were 0.86 (95% CI: 0.86 to 0.87) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.87 to 0.88), respectively.
The test AUCs were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.87 to 0.89) and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.88 to 0.90), respectively (Fig 1).

Kausalitet vs. prædiktion
Highly correlated predictors, differing in model-based importance scores, may have very similar univariate predictive ability but the one that is less predictive would be given low importance since its importance value is conditional on the highly correlated predictor being in the model.
E.g. to variable der begge er prædiktive for om man tager ud at bade (svømmebriller med vs. badetøj med) er meget lidt prædiktive, hvis konditionerede på hinanden.
Det skriver de **enormt** meget om. Antyder måske, at reviewere har været meget i tvivl – eller de tager fat i et generelt problem i litteraturen.
