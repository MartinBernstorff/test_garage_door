# Emotions shape behaviour
This doesn't mean that emotions are the only determinants of behaviour; we can override our emotions when necessary. 

But it does imply that paying attention to, and designing around our emotions during a behaviour is beneficial in shaping our future behaviours. In that sense, emotions are [[§Feedback]], allowing some parts of our brain to communicate with other parts. 

This is one of the reasons that this works: [[§The virtuous cycle of thought, action and behaviour]]
