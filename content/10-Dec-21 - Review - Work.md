# 10-Dec-21 - Review - Work
A bit of a slow day! Don't know why the productivity was relatively low â€“ prep for journal club took a long time, so that's fair, but getting the results ready was... painful.

In general, running scripts of this size through a slow interface is just going to hurt. None of the current solutions ([[Targets (R)]], caching and knitting) are much better than a "Run all chunks". If anything, speeding up the code is probably the highest leverage.

Other than that, not much to note. Would love to refocus on the most important work, so might spend some time now in the afternoon getting a version ready to send to coauthors.
