# §Debugging
Maybe improve this, and think about it formally. Unsure about to which extent this can be learned formally, Advanced R by Hadley wasn't of much help.



The techniques are going to be language specific; as such, learning to debug in each language is what'll help you out the most.

There are a few ways of avoiding or minimising time spent on debugging:
* [[§Unit Testing]]
* [[§Pair programming]]
* [[§Refactoring]]


Languages:
* [[STATA Debugging]]
