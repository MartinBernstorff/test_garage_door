# §Knowledge transfer
Also known as [[Far transfer]] and [[Distant transfer]].

Consists of three stages:
* Recognition: Matching the situation to previous information

* Recall: Recalling that information and

* Execution: Applying the information to solve the problem.

Q. Which three steps are required for succesful [[§Knowledge transfer]]?
A. Recognition, Recall and Execution

Q. How does Recognition differ from Recall for [[§Knowledge transfer]]?
A. Recognition is identifying that the situation matches information you have stored, Recall is retrieving that information from memory.
