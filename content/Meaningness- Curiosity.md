# Meaningness: Curiosity
*Close-ended curiosity* is curiousity about the world, but assuming that all questions have a definite answer - iem that the answer can be framed in a perfectly clear way, with a true/false value. Meaningness assumes that many answers are nebulous.

I think that's mostly right, in the sense that the answer to many questions is so context-dependent and/or complicated  that they are de facto nebulous.

It is super valuable for routine science, engineering etc. But not a part of the complete stance.

*Open-ended curiosity*, though, dances with nebulosity and pattern. It asks 'I wonder how this works - what opportunities will arise'. It isn't tied to questions or answers, but suspends representation of the problem for a bit. It allows confusion to persist.
