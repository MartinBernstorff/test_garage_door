# How do I avoid subjects being demoted while being edited
Currently, subjects can be demoted while I'm editing them. Since I'm editing the branch notes, rather than the trunks, the trunks get old "last modified" dates and can be demoted completely.

I may want to [[Always promote 2 of the 22 most recent branches]] or something similar, to do my best to avoid this.
