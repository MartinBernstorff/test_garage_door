# ?First things first
	* Take the money out of the account for savings
	* Plan time for most important projects

This ensures that what is most important actually happens, and that the trade-offs you’ll have to do default to compromising on the less important things.

### Generalising to time
Fits poorly with [[Balance WIP]], in that it makes it hard to [[Minimise multitasking]]. At least at the level of days – you could decide to spend whole days on the part of your life that are most important to you. This’ll increase [[§Staleness (productivity)]] and obligation, though :-(

This doesn’t mean literally doing it first thing in the day, but it does mean to make space for it first, making sure it gets done. Then you can make space for the smaller, less important things. This requires that we [[Focus on what you would like to do more of]].

The book suggests making “a little time, no matter how much, for your important things today”, or to “work on your most important project for the first hour of each day”.
