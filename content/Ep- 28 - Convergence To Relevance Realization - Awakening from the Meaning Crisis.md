Proposes new terminology for tension in problem-solving: Heuristics vs. algorithmic.

Heuristics are required, because algorithms run into [[Combinatorial Explosion]].

[[Essentialism]] is a heuristic, but not all categories have essenses (e.g. chair, lion etc.). 

[[Relevance Realisation]] is the consequence of getting good at [[Define the problem]], which Vervaeke calls “Insight”.

Since there are infinite potential consequences of every action ([[Butterfly Effect]]), to avoid [[Combinatorial Explosion]], [[Relevance Realisation]] requires us to ignore information *without checking it*. Otherwise, all your time will be spent on the checking, you’ll essentially be [[Thrashing (scheduling)]].

This is also called the [[Frame Problem]].

What is relevant for problem solving now determines salience/attention, in the near-future determines working memory, and in the far-future determines long-term memory. It’s an incredibly far-reaching problem to solve because it is at the core of what we want to optimise for. 

How do relations of relevance differ from relations of causality? Relevance is much more - it’s a causal relationship, but also its amplitude and modifiability in a given context.

*My sidetracked notes*

In this framing, teaching citizens, or journalists, or politicians basic scientific methodology is a way of bootstrapping our society’s capacity for [[Relevance Realisation]]. [[Teaching Epistemology]]

How does [[Confirmation bias]] fit into this framing? Which heuristics, that are typically adaptive, might give rise to it?

What is relevant depends on what problem you’re trying to solve. And which problems are worth solving can be approximated by [[§Regret Minimisation]], and ideally shaped into a [[§Vision]].

One of the problems with school is that it deprives us of real-life experience, which then again makes it much harder for us to prioritise, to arrive at [[Relevance Realisation]]. It assumes that we can [[§Forecasting]] what is required, 10, 20 years down the line, but this seems increasingly unlikely.

The alternative is teaching general, “critical thinking” skills. But is school really any good at that?
