# Decrease distraction in thinking
You don’t want to waste time considering ideas that aren’t important right now. Sometimes you’re missing resources, or you’re waiting for some dependency.

Project/idea-lists are terrible at this. As you skim through them, a plethora of memories activate, most of which are irrelevant to what you end up doing.

OTOH, [[Motivation is increased by salience]], so you'd need some other means of keeping projects salient, or at least making them salient at the right time. I don't know how to do that yet.

	* Furthermore, it’s great at [[Decrease options to make decision-making easier]], since it has the “actual view” which only shows me the next steps! This helps [[Decrease distraction in thinking]].
* [[How do I keep next steps salient in knowledge work]]
	* Currently I switch to taskheat after some time just spinning my wheels. As an alternative, you can do a very short daily review of projects, eg. Reviewing the “actual” pane in Taskheat every day after doing work in notes. This helps [[Decrease distraction in thinking]]. For entrainment, I’ll add it to habitifier.
