	* Clearer processes does allow for clearer thinking around them; we create models and vocabulary that we didn’t have before. But it also takes quite a bit of time. [[Optimisation needs to be worth it]].

When, then, is optimisation worth it? When it pays itself back (which we typically over-estimate, since we underestimate the time for implementation and over-estimate the duration for which we will use the tool), when it enables new behaviours that we value, or when it is just plain fun.

Because optimisation typically hinges on the long-term dividends paid, [[Do we need long-term feedback loops]].
