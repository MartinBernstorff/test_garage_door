# 15-Dec-21 - Work
*How am I feeling today?*
Very good! Looking forward to meeting with Simon Lauritsen, and hoping that LPR2-3 will be ready for today. Also a great prompt re: thinking vs. Doing â€“ I'm doing too much, because my actions aren't effective in programming.

Really looking forward to settling the apartment, would love for the seller to sign pretty soon. Looking forward to that happening too, then a few days later I'm practically a home-owner!

- Fix minor issues with [[LPR2->LPR3]], then it should be ready for manuscript update (I hope!!!)

* [[Simon Meyer Lauritsen, Meeting 15/12/2021]]

- Aggregate learnings from the struggle of the past couple of days (e.g. caching preprocessing)
	- E.g. "You notice you're spending a lot of time waiting for data-wrangling so you can modify a plot. How might you save time" - cache
		- [[Working on large datasets in R]]

* Consider adding suggestions when adding a new note - e.g. 
```
*Suggestions*

*Agenda*
* Nourish seedlings

/Afternoon/
* Review the morning. b
```

* Improve the speed of the individual_diagnoses pipeline? 
	* Takes more than 3x the time of the others to run.

I'm doing too little thinking when programming, based on me getting into flow while grinding
