# Does gaming induce anhedonia for me?
It appears to me that after a heavy gaming session (mostly FPS), I'm more easily annoyed, have a harder time sinking into deep focus and am less motivated to improve at something. 

They also make me completely lose track of time, shifting the balance in both [[MIL balances stimulation and relaxation]] and [[Balance flow and experience]].

I'm not committed to a proposed mechanism, but games may desensitise me to progress because they provide it at a huge rate and intensity. Some of them have become very effective skinner-boxes, whereas in reality, progress is often ambiguous.

Another model is that games can help fill the need for achievement, making other (real) modes of achievement seem less attractive. For more on this, see: http://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2006_RyanRigbyPrzybylski_MandE.pdf, especially table 8 and 9.

This is speculation, definitely, but it’s a workable model. There are [[§Gaming upsides]], though, so it’s about how to get the good while avoiding the bad ([[§Gaming]]).
