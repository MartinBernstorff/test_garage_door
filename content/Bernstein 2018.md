* [[Collaboration speeds up problem solving]]
	* See also figure 3 of [[Bernstein 2018]].
Numbers on graph are number of rounds. After eg. the second round, CT (constant teamwork) significantly outperforms the other areas on # of correct solution legs.
* [[Ability to reload a solution decreases maximum quality of solutions]]
	* From [[Bernstein 2018]], shows that if we’re looking to find the optimum solution, ability to refer to previous solutions is not necessarily a good idea. However, in real-world scenarios we often want to [[Increase reusability]] because the solutions we have are adequate. Furthermore, speed is often way more important than finding the optimal solution – eg. producing a computer is way more important than finding the best way of producing a computer. Collaboration and storage work way better for speed, [[Collaboration speeds up problem solving]].
	* Furthermore, [[Bernstein 2018]] shows that this is the case if we’re interested in finding the global optimum – but the o
	* Another is that [[Bernstein 2018]] only allowed recollection of the previous best solution, which would lead you straight to the local optimum. If they had instead allowed recollection of any previous solution, you could avoid creating the same solution multiple times, or iterate from one point.
	* Another parallel can be drawn to how civilisations advance – they tend to advance by building on each other’s solutions and knowledge. But [[Bernstein 2018]] didn’t test problems where partial solutions can be combined.
* [[Independent problem solving increases maximum solution quality]]
	* One example: You want to avoid sharing ideas in a brainstorming process until after some idea generation has taken place, see 20 from [[Bernstein 2018]].
* [[Problem solving in teams]]

* [[Should I ask for help very early in the problem solving process?]]
	* Probably not in real life. You need to first [[Define the problem]], to have any chance of solving it. Furthermore, communication is way more lossy in real life than it is in [[Bernstein 2018]], which would dramatically increase overhead in the collaboration condition. Given the high amount of prior information you have for many situations, this overhead is very detrimental for the speed at which you explore the problem space.
