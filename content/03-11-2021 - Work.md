# 03/11/2021 - Work
*How am I feeling?*
Excited about the possibilities in work and private life! Ready to get to work and get stuff done. Prepping for Sandbjerg, forming questions, and then programming the answers to those; that's what this is all about!

Today's agenda is relatively simple:

*Agenda*
- Skrive til Lasse om salat

- Sandbjerg pr√¶sentation prep
	- Outline basic version
	- Check if code covers the assumptions we can test
	- Export figures

- Feasibility-Mapper
	- Prep the results for Sandbjerg
	- Keep refactoring
	- Add Lasse to it? It appears imperfect that he'll have to wait for me.

* Nourish seedlings

- Skrive til Mathias

- Bede Theis om billede
