# Building in public for medicine
Incorporate notes, a website and Anki cards.

Eg. have a webpage for each disease, but categorised by specialty. That page consists of your notes, as well as questions along the way. The A. part can be hovered over to reveal the answers, and all the questions can be downloaded as an Anki deck at the bottom.

Or integrate them with Orbit.
