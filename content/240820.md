I have to remember that an infant won't always be an infant. Every day, they gradually grow a lottle more independent, and some of them grow easier.

I may have overestimated the duration of infancy and how much time a child requires.

Being ambivalent isn't a sign you definitely don't want a child, either. It's a sign of being a rational human who knows that both choices will afford different options.
