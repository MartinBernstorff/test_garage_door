# §Buffer (flow theory)
Sommer buffers are also a [[§Queue]].

The purpose of buffers is to stabilise. They can help allow [[§Batching]].

* [[Buffers stabilise]]

* [[Buffers cause delay]]
	* [[Buffers delay solutions to problems]]

* [[Lists of Opportunities]]

But it *shouldn’t be*:
* A [[§Buffer]]
	* Or a [[§Queue]]

Which all imply that we should handle all the items on the list.

* [[Stress and queues]]

Q. What is the criterium for determining a buffers ideal size (maximising throughput while minimising latency)?
A. Just big enough that the buffer is never empty
