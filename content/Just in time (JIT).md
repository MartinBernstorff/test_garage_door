# Just in time (JIT)

## Backlinks
* [[JIT vs. JIC]]
	* [[Just in time (JIT)]] vs. [[JIC]].
* [[When do I want to select new projects]]
	* It's also a [[Just in time (JIT)]] vs. [[JIC]] situation.
* [[Minimise overproduction]]
	* To avoid this, use [[Just in time (JIT)]], implement a "tact time" (eg. agile cycles), or introduce a pull system (eg. Kanban).
* [[§How I schedule tasks]]
	* I do a combination of [[Just in time (JIT)]] and [[Impact Density Scheduling]].
	* For things that don’t realise their impact before a deadline, I wait until ~1.5x the expected completion time to start it. This minimises [[Carrying costs]] through [[Just in time (JIT)]] principles.
* [[Minimise inventory]]
	* Possible countermeasures are [[Just in time (JIT)]].
* [[How do I keep next steps salient in knowledge work]]
	* Scheduling it as daily is a [[JIC]] instead of [[Just in time (JIT)]], but running it as an experiment for now isn’t a bad idea.
