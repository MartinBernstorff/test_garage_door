# How might software support our intentions?
How does software that supports our intentions look? Eg. [[complice.co]] or the product hunt app that integrates with Todoist ([[getslash.co]]).

One potential project might be to adapt something like get slash to complice, so that we can have a small overlay showing our current intention. [[Slash for complice]].
