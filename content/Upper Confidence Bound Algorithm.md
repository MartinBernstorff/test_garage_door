# Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm
Pick the option with the highest upper confidence bound. Similar to the [[Gittins index]], but don't require future discounting and are much easier to compute.

	* For an exact solution, look at the [[Gittins index]].

	* Turns out Gittins indexes are pretty hard to compute. Might instead use an [[Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm]], Eg. calculate some interval estimating confidence, and then order the options by their upper bound.
