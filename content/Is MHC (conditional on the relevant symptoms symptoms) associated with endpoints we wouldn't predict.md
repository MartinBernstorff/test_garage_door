# Is MHC (conditional on the relevant symptoms symptoms) associated with endpoints we wouldn't predict
Ie. is MHC, conditional on feeling low and nervousness, predictive of SSRI-prescription? If so, it would appear that MHC captures more information than the relevant symptoms, that it is a useful construct in itself.

This may be due to other factors that are associated with MHC, and not MHC itself, but that is useful too!
