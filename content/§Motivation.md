# §Motivation
As far as I know, a given motivation can be described by three dimensions:

* [[Motivational Intensity]]
* [[§Intrinsic motivation]]
* [[Motivational integration]], as primarily explained by [[OIT]]

Q. Which dimensions might characterise a motivation?
A. Intrinsics, intensity and integration.

## Backlinks
* [[§Hope]]
	* Hope arises when we have a [[§Vision]] of a better world and we can see a path towards it ([[§Expectancy]], [[§Motivation]]).
