Me: [[§Boredom]] helps us activate ourselves when the current activity is free from novelty, i.e. that we don’t learn from it. 

[[Boredom proneness]] is when this becomes so pronounced that it’s maladaptive. Even in situations where we are learning, we don’t feel stimulated, so we move on to something else. E.g. [[ADHD]].
