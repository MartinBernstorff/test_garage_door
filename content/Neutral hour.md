A tool for valuing time and energy.

E.g. if an activity takes 1 hour to do, but takes another neutral hour to recuperate from, its cost is 2 neutral hours.

A neutral hour is an hour where you have the same energy after as you had before it started. The cost of an activity is:
> How many hours would you need to complete activity X and recuperate so that you feel as fresh at the end as at the start?

Beware of losing slack, though! The value of a recuperative hour increases dramatically if you're fatigued.

* [[Make frequent activities less draining]]
* [[Make recuperation more effective]]

## Backlinks
* [[Match activities to your energy level]]
	* This is a consequence of [[Neutral hour]] – the time cost of an activity depends on your current energy state.
* [[Bike maintenance]]
	* What is my current rate for a [[Neutral hour]]?
* [[§How I schedule tasks]]
	* I want to maximise my total throughput. This means [[Impact Density Scheduling]], with an adjustment for [[Neutral hour]].

	* Read up and add flashcards for [[Neutral hour]]
* [[16-Dec-21 - Work]]
	* It's called [[Neutral hour]]! Might be worth taking your most frequent activities and estimating their neutral-hours costs – and see how well that matches your current way of spending time. Maybe even use [YNAB-style prioritising](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wllgq9PxWWFIQ2veUnJl3GfKpDvTwNVQQUeQeXmjUAA/edit#gid=1443084366) to see how your weeks look.
* [[How might gaming relate to an unhelpful belief]]
	* I would be someone who's dedicated to doing good work, but who takes care of himself in his free time (through exercise and other activities the refuel [[Neutral hour]]) and has fun while doing it!)
* [[Whether a task is recuperating depends on current energy level]]
	* In the terminology of [[Neutral hour]] – e.g. walking will get you above your starting energy level if you're tired when you start.
