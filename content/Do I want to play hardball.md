# Do I want to play hardball
The criteria that make me consider it:
[[What I value in health]]

* It's a fun way to get aerobic exercise
	* How much aerobic exercise do I get?
	* How much do I need?
	* Which diseases contribute to the most DALYs in Denmark?
* It gives me a sense of competence
* It allows me to practise my collaboration skills

There are a bunch of negatives, though:
* It's pretty low status
	* Many of the people out there are pretty weird, ie. they make inappropriate jokes.
* Risk of joint wear/injury
* I find it a lot of fun - which can also mean that I'll spend too much time on it compared to the other things I find important 

If I were to start, there's going to be some purchases:
* Gun (G36C?), 1100 or UMP (800)
	* Charger, 150
	* Batteri, 100
	* Aimpoint, 250-500
		* Riser, 50
* Glasses, 250
* Mask, 150
* Ammo, 100
* Knæbeskyttere (200,-)
* Trøje (399,-)
* Lygte – [3W Multifunktionslygte  ASG MULTI LYGTE 16927 - Køb på Rodes.dk](https://www.rodes.dk/3w-multifunktionslygte.html)


If I end up doing more of it, remember that you want a gun that fits in your bike bag. This is a decent argument for getting a pistol, actually. Or a G36C, which also has a riser.
