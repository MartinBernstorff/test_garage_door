# Handle boredom skillfully
What do I mean by skillfully? 

If idle, to seek out activities that give you [[§Deep Novelty]], which help you adapt to the future, which are aligned with your [[§Vision]]. As opposed to having a default of swiping facebook on your phone. 

If working on something difficult, I mean to either endure it if you’re close to solving a problem, or, if you need time for [[§Incubation]], to change to a different activity.

* [[§Boredom]]
	* It is unpleasant, and through that unpleasantness motivates us to [[§Curiosity]], to want to learn or seek new goals. Enduring [[§Boredom]] in itself is not a virtue, then, but to [[Handle boredom skillfully]] is.
