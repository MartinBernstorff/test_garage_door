# When does it make sense to confront problems?
Not all problems are worth confronting – it is costly both emotionally and time-wise. They carry opportunity costs; as alternatives, we can distract ourselves or spend our time on other problems.

However, solving a problem can make a huge difference in your life. What makes a problem more likely to be a good investment?

* It is tractable, or we don’t know whether it is tractable
	* This includes problems that can be (partially) solved via emotional support
* It has large effects
* The effects are temporally stable, ie. they won’t fade away

And, in a world where you care about helping others than yourself:
* The problem is general, ie. it affects others than yourself 
* The solution is transferable

There are likely some personal characteristics as well:
* You’re good at solving problems
* You have a hard time accepting friction
