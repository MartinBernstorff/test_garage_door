# 14-Dec-21 - Homely
*How am I feeling?*
Pretty good! Using the iPad as a thinking tool to plan the day is a great move! It helps me settle down, and makes it easier for me to focus when doing [[§Deliberation]] and [[§Int. Reading]].

* Cook sweet potato dinner

* Pause FW membership

* Look for today’s Omicron data

* Look into trading options

* Plan this week - what do I want to happen?

* Pause FW membership

*Misc.*
* Finish reading wikipedia on scheduling (open in Safari) - does this add stuff to [[§Scheduling]]?

* Add a #daily hashtag to daily notes? Can allow me to setup an easily browsable widget on the iPad and iPhone.
