# Theory of Constraints
The Theory of Constraints is created by Eliyahu Goldratt. It’s a way of analysing systems and figuring out where to focus improvement efforts. It doesn’t apply to everything, see [[For which tasks does Theory of Constraints apply]].

It argues that you should, in order:
1. [[Optimise constraints]]
2. [[Subordinate non-bottlenecks]]
3. [[Add capacity]]

	* You can improve efficiency by small changes (e.g. keyboard shortcuts) or large changes (e.g. doing the task completely differently, or doing a different task for the same objective), for example [[Theory of Constraints]].
* [[Systems should be self cleaning]]
	* From a [[Theory of Constraints]] standpoint, having to process the contents of a system without using them is using resources from the bottleneck (your attention) on something that doesn't increase throughput.

	* This if further emphasised if we ignore the [[Theory of Constraints]], and assume that not filling our time is by definition a waste.

	* One realisation is that energy management is, to some extent, like supply chain management, and thus subject to the [[Theory of Constraints]]. This is meant in the sense that we only have X extremely focused hours in us in a day, and the rest are more fungible. In that sense, focused hours can be thought of as one “machine” in a sequence of machines required to get work done.
