# Do you want to use an auto-scheduler for work
Most of the arguments in [[$Auto-schedulers]] apply to this question as well, especially given that work is affected by many of the exceptions to [[$Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]], eg.
* [[Sequence matters when there are task dependencies]]
* [[Sequence matters when I am not the bottleneck]]
* [[Sequence matters when context switching costs are high]]

This one specifically can be quite relevant for work. I often have a bunch of very small adjustments to a manuscript, or programming tasks, and this means that the task-switch/hours worked ratio is high.

* [[Sequence matters when a task drains a resource on a temporary basis]]

Phenomenologically, it may increase my stress since a tiny bit. However, right now my stress from work is incredibly low. As complexity from work increases, it may even decrease stress since [[Auto-schedulers remove cognitive overhead from calendar constraints]].

One further worry is that [[Auto-schedulers don't care about variety]], but that can relatively easily be changed.
