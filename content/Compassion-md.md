# Should I be good or work to look good?
Being compassionate increases evaluation by others, while trying to increase evaluation by others tends to decrease it.

# How do I best cultivate compassion?**
CCARE: http://ccare.stanford.edu/education/about-compassion-cultivation-training-cct/register-online/
Compassion-cultivation training (CCT) is not available for reasonable amounts of money or in DK at the moment. As such, cultivating compassion is going to be mostly based on loving-kindness meditation, and trying to move that into daily life by informal practice.

See "Altruism" book by Ricard, chapter 21.
