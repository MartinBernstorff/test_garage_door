# §My Vision for Friendships
I think, as my life progresses, having traditions is going to be essential for keeping up the connection with many of my friends.

The ones I would especially like to stay in touch with are:
* Mads
* Simon
* Ebbe
* (Check for more on airtable)

I’ll have to talk to them explicitly about how we stay in touch, otherwise I fear we’ll fade out.

	* The good life consists of service to something larger than yourself. This is manifests through two prongs, great work ([[§My Vision for Work]]) and rich relationships ([[§My Vision for Friendships]], [[§My Vision for a Tribe]], [[§My Vision for a Partnership]], [[§My Vision for a Family]]).
