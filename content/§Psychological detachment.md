# §Psychological detachment
[[Lack of psychological detachment may be a marker of stress, rather than a causal mechanism]], but there is some [[Evidence for causal psychological detachment]].

But I'm not sure I need more causal evidence – I feel pretty confident that separating work and leisure is a great idea, in the sense that I need time where I don't worry about how I can do the most good for the most people.

It allows me to let go of obligations and to have time where I can just do what matters to me.

Q. What is your greatest benefit of psychological detachment?
A. It allows you time where you can just have fun.
