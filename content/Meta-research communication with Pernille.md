# Meta-research communication with Pernille
Fits her job search well, fits my goals in life well, and I can probably use some PhD ECTS on it as well.

Does it make sense to trial this on the general pop, then target it to politicians? Quite high leverage. Are politicians interested in this, i.e. a minimal introduction to how to ask qualified questions of health researchers.

Can I use the university's 2025 vision (something "democracy").
