# Revisit inklings ad-hoc
One example is collecting them all in Airtable, and then writing a script for revisiting the most relevant notes when I want to. I can use that same process to send an email, to keep the ideas in my "peripheral vision".

Another is to randomly promote notes based on their "p" value.
