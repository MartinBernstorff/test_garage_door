# Meditation might widen error bars on predictions
This might lead to depression if we feel uncertain about whether there are benefits to taking action. The contrast between inaction and action is weakened if the confidence intervals of both are widened.

This is obviously not the only effect of meditation, but it is one.

This implies that meditation can be used in periods to widen incorrectly narrow confidence intervals, and then allowing experience to narrow them back down – something akin to annealing.

It might also explain why meditation can be relaxing – wide confidence intervals means that fewer perceptions sound the alarm for "prediction error". It might also explain why meditation can be relaxing.

This might provide an evolutionary benefit from [[§Overconfidence]] as well – it might result in increased motivation, since you're confident that you can make the world the way you want it to be, and you're confident that that'll make you happy.
