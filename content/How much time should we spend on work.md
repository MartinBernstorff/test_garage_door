# How much time should we spend on work



Some indicators:

1.  **You’re beyond your work saturation point if you:
    -   Have an hour or less of free time on most days.
    -   Require late nights to finish work within deadlines
    -   You complete almost all assignments the day before they are due.
    -   You spend most nights in at least one meeting.
    -   You frequently fail to follow through on activity related obligations.
    -   You don’t really understand a lot of what is going on in your classes until you study right before the exam.
