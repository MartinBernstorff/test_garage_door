# Identify the signs
You want to figure out what indicates that there actually is a problem? In what case did someone feel like something wasnâ€™t right? What causes someone pain?

## Backlinks
* [[Define the problem]]
	* What does this mean? Firstly, it means [[Identify the signs]] that something is problematic. Then it means to [[Establish a causal model]] of why that is, to identify which levers you can push.
* [[Establish the criteria]]
	* This is typically the reverse of [[Identify the signs]]. It helps you keep your mind sharp as you try to solve the problem.
