# Mieke gets frustrated in discussions
 [[Argue about opinions, not people]], I feel that Mieke tends to get frustrated and angry with me when we discuss things, Eg. cupboard spacing, krænkelseskultur, feminism – or something much simpler, like what they've been reading recently.

I am probably not easy to have discussions with, but I really try to do my best and I don't get feedback from her. Whenever we disagree, she gets really angry, notices her anger, and then shuts down. She dislikes that, so I think she prefers that we don't really discuss anything at all.
