# Artificial novelty makes us more neurotic
Since the media presents a sensationalist view of the world, [[Artificial novelty distorts our view of the world]], and since recency has become very important, we don't get trends from the media â€“ we get whatever has happened in the last news cycle.

This means that we don't get information on how the world is changing, we just get whatever random information has popped up in the last 24 hours. This makes for neuroticism, changing back and forth between events. We don't get to understand the world better, we're merely thrown around by noise.
