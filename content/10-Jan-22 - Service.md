# 10-Jan-22 - Service
*How am I feeing today?*
A little tired/overwhelmed. Many balls in the air right now, and much to do! Very good to have a proper weekend, where I could let NSSH go. 

Excited about apartment, even though I'll have courses and have to do a lecture in the days where I take over the apartment ðŸ˜‚
