# When does it make sense to map systems?
There is tension between systems mapping and our general understanding of change â€“ we tend to think of change as a linear, one-time thing, whereas systems are all about feedback loops, threshold effects etc.

In that sense, systems are about what drives or maintains a state. Our linear thinking is about changing from one system to another, about events rather than processes.

Systems mapping, then, makes sense when:
* We want to change or understand something
* We can construct a valid model
	* We can identify the most important stocks and their interactions
	* The system is of sufficiently low complexity to be explainably mapped
	* The model is somewhat stable over time
* The model might be useful
	* We need to prepare for potential new inputs/outputs
	* We're looking for places to intervene to change the system
