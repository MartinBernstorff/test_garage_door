# Book: Meaningness
It appears that:

* No one quite knows how meaning works 
	* Theories that pretend to are either nihilist, eternalist or believe that meaning is entirely subjective, and all are wrong and/lr harmful
* We aren't likely to achieve full understanding anytime soon
* But we can't wait for full understanding, because we need to live life now.
* This means we have to do the best we can with what we know
	* Luckily, incomplete understanding is not a huge barrier to living life – we don't need to understand how something works to understand how to use it ([[We tend to overrate our 'how-it-works' understanding]]).
	* It's better to be roughly right than precisely wrong 

The combination of complete stances' emotional texture is "appreciative curiosity", wonder, play, creation.
