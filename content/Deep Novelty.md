Q. What is deeply novel?
A. Something that adds to or changes your model of the world.

Q. When is deep novelty helpful?
A. If it makes you more capable of getting what you want.

Dichotomizing into Deep Novelty and Shallow Novelty is losing a lot of detail, but it is useful. 

News that fit into a known pattern and don't generalise are very shallow, but science that runs counter to what you thought is deeply novel.

It's useful because it separates the noise ([[False Novelty]]) from the signal, it allows us to focus on discovering levers for change and minimising uncertainty.
