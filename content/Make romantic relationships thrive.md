# Make romantic relationships thrive
Most of this is inspired by [[ACT with Love]]. There is further information in [[RMT]].

[[Long-term relationship determinants]]

[[Emotions are unstable]], [[Emotional love is volatile]] and [[Love makes us vulnerable]]. This makes intimate relationships emotionally volatile.

We have many myths about relationships that cause problems for us. The reality is, [[It's unlikely you'll find the perfect partner]], [[A meaningful relationship contains discomfort]], [[Emotional love is volatile]].

However, even though [[It's unlikely you'll find the perfect partner]], there are varying degrees of fit. LTRs are succesful if they help both parties live lives true to themselves, meaning that [[LTRs need value overlap]] and [[LTRs thrive with goal overlap]].

It's important to [[Live by values, not by rules]]. In romantic relationships, this means that even if your values at first glance appear to be significantly different, it may be just an overlying rule that ties into a shared, deeper value.

Some qualities are going to be universally helpful; agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, mindfulness.

You need to [[Decide whether you're committed to the relationship]].

When that is decided, what matters is that you [[Take action on your values to live a meaningful life]].

You want to [[Nurture relationships]] and [[Protect relationships]].
