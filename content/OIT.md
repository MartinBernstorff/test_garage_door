# OIT
Goal integration is mediated by a plethora of things.

* [[Goal contents mediate goal integration]]

OIT is at the cognitive level; it’s about why we believe we undertake a given action. An integrated motivation means something that we endorse cognitively. 

## Backlinks
* [[Live by values, not by rules]]
	* This makes your life infinitely better. It's essentially about making sure that your motivations are identified/integrated rather than introjected, terminology from [[OIT]].
* [[§Motivation]]
	* Goal integration [[OIT]], as measured by the [[RAI]]
* [[Intentional behaviour can be changed]]
	* You can change the content of motivation [[GCT]], integration of motivation [[OIT]] and [[Motivational Intensity]].
* [[When do I want to select new projects]]
	* Also matters with motivation, both [[Motivational Intensity]], [[OIT]] and, to a lesser extent, [[GCT]].
* [[Struggling with emotions leads to problematic behavior]]
	* The struggle is the sign of a lack of acceptance, of wanting the emotions to go away. And just like in [[OIT]], if you're motivated towards a very specific goal, you'll do what you can to reach it.
* [[OIT is about cognitions, not emotions]]
	* [[OIT]]
* [[Hedonism for escaping discomfort drains the experience]]
	* Corresponds well with [[OIT]], as well as [[Approach motivation]].
* [[Living by values brings well-being]]
	* Living by values brings well-being, see [[OIT]].
* [[What is my stance on duty?]]
	* Duty is an interesting theme. On the one hand, it has connotations of doing things that you don't want to, that aren't motivationally integrated ([[OIT]]).
