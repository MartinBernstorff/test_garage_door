# Ask Lasse about how we can help each other get better at what we do
A “mastery” approach, basically something like [[Informational feedback for daily work]] and [[Get a mentor to improve rapidly]].

It really depends on what we wish to get better at. [[What do we want to get better at at work?]]

* Record us as we are programming

* Pair programming

* Code review

* Compare time spent?
	* Unlikely to be terribly helpful
