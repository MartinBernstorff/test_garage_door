# §Caching
The point of a cache is to decrease access-times, or speeding up search. The cost is whatever the price of the faster memory is.

Another way of speeding up access-times is [[§Sorting]], where the cost is compute.

How, then, do you know whether [[§Sorting]] or [[§Caching]] is the right thing to do? Depends on the cost - is compute more expensive than memory?
