# P - Determine whether motivational intensity is a separate motivational dimension
Predictions:

On the [[RAI]], I would predict that amotivation is similar to low scores on all other motivation types. The question becomes, then, whether [[Amotivation]] predicts further variance than just a lack of motivation.

One might argue that it can. Items on amotivation from [[Sheldon 2017]] include having lost reasons, and not knowing why one is taking specific actions.

The [[RAI]] measures autonomy, and explicitly responding that you don't have any good reasons for your actions is probably the lowest level of autonomy. This is further corroborated by Table 2 in [[Sheldon 2017]], where amotivation shows differential correlations to the different subscales.

OTOH, I would expect it to strongly correlate with the sum of the other items.

First research what litterature there already is.

Although mathematically three parameters are necessary to describe the variety of individual profiles, empirically we found the quadratic term (A) to be redundant. Its high corre- lation with the intercept (C) was consistently reproduced across our six independent samples, suggesting that RAI and the Mean score (essentially equivalent to the two other parameters of the model) may capture fairly well the two most important aspects of individual profiles: elevation (which can be interpreted as the strength of motivation) and location of the peak (the predominant motivation type).

Check whether there is someone doing SDT research at AU.

Write a proposal to them.
Hire me as a research assistant, I do it on the side while completing medicine.

It can bridge the gap between more micro-motivational theories and SDT.

First project could be questionnaire based, using principal component analysis.
