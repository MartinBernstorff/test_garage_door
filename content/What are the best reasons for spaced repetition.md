*earnestness, ardor, curiosity — not: duty, instrumentalism, grinding*

Spaced repetition is about continually engaging with what you care most about, the stuff that gives your life meaning.

It's not about eating your brocolli, not for things you "should" be engaged with. It results in learning, but the goal isn't to learn, it's to be able to do something that brings you meaning in the world which you find meaningful.

Q. How is the motivation of my daily spaced repetition practice different from typical education?
A. While it results in learning, the goal isn't to learn – it's to be able to do something meaningful in the world.
