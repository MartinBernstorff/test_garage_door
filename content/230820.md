While seeing a child succeed could be incredibly rewarding, I also think it'll be incredibly draining! Lots of extra monotonous maintenance tasks (changing diapers), lots of emotional conflict (the child being dissatisfied with something), and lots of extra conflict with my partner (disagreeing about parenting or how to distribute tasks).

While I can mitigate many of the timing and logistical challenges of parenthood, it's in large part the emotional and relationship challenges I'd like to avoid. Furthermore, even if all the logistical work was taken care of for me, I probably still wouldn't want children. The idea of interacting with them doesn't appeal much to me.

I may be slightly minimising the good that comes from being a parent, though, especially because my own teenage years were so tough.

Part of it is that I worry that Mieke won't be a good team-player as a parent. I fear that her emotions will run off with her as the child doesn't behave as she expected, or being a parent is much harder than expected. Then I'll have to manage not only my self, but also her.
