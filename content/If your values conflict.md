# If your values conflict
That's a valid point! Rather than not acting on your values, this means that you'll have to be skillful at finding compromise.

The reality is, there will be times that you have to prioritise your values; to focus more on some domains of life than others. This calls for soul-searching; for asking yourself, ‘What’s most important at this moment in my life, given all my conflicting concerns?’ Then choose to act on that value, rather than wasting your time uselessly worrying about what you might be giving up or missing out on.
