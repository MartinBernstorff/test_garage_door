# Batch size (ML)
{[[Batch size (ML)]]}: {The amount of samples in an [[Iteration (ML)]]}. 

Q. How does an [[Epoch (ML)]] differ from an [[Iteration (ML)]]?
A. An [[Iteration (ML)]] is training once across one [[Batch size (ML)]]. An [[Epoch (ML)]] is training once across the entire dataset.

Q. What is the advantage of increasing the [[Batch size (ML)]]?
A. Tends to make computations faster.
