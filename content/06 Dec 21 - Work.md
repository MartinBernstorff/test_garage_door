# 06 Dec 21 - Work
*How am I feeling?*
Okay! A little down, maybe due to feeling that I'm committing myself too hard to things that won't matter in the long run. Or maybe just an aversion to commitment due to previous commitments failing. 

My best guess is that it's due to longer-term planning + the `#project` implementation. I have to take this seriously; I think it'll be fine – and I might even be able to use [[Recategorisation (emotions)]] to interpret the feeling as determination, rather than obligation. 

Looking forward to Linear Algebra with Lasse! Challenging my abstract thinking is something I've been missing for quite a while!
