# Anki cannot help with knowledge refinement
Ie. it is up to you to figure out:

1. Whether it matters that you're failing a card
	1. If so, why you're failing it
		1. You aren't trying to remember it in the first place
		2. You're trying to remember without forging connections
		3. You aren't reviewing frequently enough
		4. There's memory interference
	2. If not, whether that implies suspending/deleting more cards
