# ?Use cloze-deletions to learn sets and lists
Makes it it easier to provide consistent answers ([[Retrieval prompts should permit only one answer]]).

The big question is whether I’ll “overfit”; I must keep the prompts as short as possible (to give only context that’ll be available at the time I’ll need the information), but as long as necessary ([[?Retrieval prompts should include (only) the context available at usage time]]).

It really depends on the use-case too. Typically, [[Don’t memorise lists]].
* When you need to get *every* item on the list? 
	* If possible, checklists are probably a better bet. Can you solve it with notes with faster lookup speed? 
	* Can you split the list into categories, and then join them by memorising the categories? This works for multiple levels, too! E.g. to memorise interventions for the actuely ill patient: ABCDE > A: Manual, instruments, call for help > Manual: Kæbeløft og bøje nakke bagover.
	* Perhaps even subsets of n = 1?
	* [[?Memorise lists for medicine]]

* If you don’t need to get *every* item, but rather associate them, is a list the appropriate tool? Or is a set of compare/contrast flashcards better?

* Or is there a logical sequence? If so, cloze overlapper is probably pretty good.
