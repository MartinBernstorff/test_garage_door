# Define the problem
What does this mean? Firstly, it means [[Identify the signs]] that something is problematic. Then it means to [[Establish a causal model]] of why that is, to identify which levers you can push.

Defining the problem informs whether and what information you need to make a decision, or to make progress on getting away from where you are and towards somewhere else.

Part of defining the problem is breaking it down into its component parts, so that you can make way on them individually. This is not always easy, and may require research on its own, eg. which parameters are most important for determining relationship satisfaction.

However, some factors may be more important to you than the average person, so [[Make the decision that's right for you]].  

Do I think that this process can improve on [[§Novelty search]] for finding interesting research problems? [[Discover interesting problems]], [[Select the right problems]].

Q. How does one define the problem?
A. Identify the signs and establish a causal model.

	* To look for relevant information we first need to [[Define the problem]]. This means that every problem starts with some degree of personal thought. 
	* Thinking about them yourself also tends to keep you focused on the problem at hand. Reading what others have thought quickly leads to you browsing rather than thinking. This can be somewhat offset by writing and [[Define the problem]], keeping you focused on what you need the information for.

* [[Mieke may not be great at solving problems]]
	* I don't feel Mieke has always done that; sometimes she just hands off a problem, or even just a symptom, expecting a solution. I'd love for her to get better at [[Define the problem]] first.

	* A good way to [[Define the problem]] is one which limits the search space to afford [[Insight problem solving]].

* [[Should I ask for help very early in the problem solving process?]]
	* Probably not in real life. You need to first [[Define the problem]], to have any chance of solving it. Furthermore, communication is way more lossy in real life than it is in [[Bernstein 2018]], which would dramatically increase overhead in the collaboration condition. Given the high amount of prior information you have for many situations, this overhead is very detrimental for the speed at which you explore the problem space.
