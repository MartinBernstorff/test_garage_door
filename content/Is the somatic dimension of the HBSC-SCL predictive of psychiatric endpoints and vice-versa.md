# Is the somatic dimension of the HBSC-SCL predictive of psychiatric endpoints and vice-versa
(ie is there a "psychiatric" MHC and a "somatic" MHC)

If strongly so, it indicates that MHC captures mostly early symptoms of what we categorise as psychiatric disorders.

This is supported by Gobina 2015.

When I say endpoints, I mean medication use and hospital contacts. If it is associated in non-face-valid ways, that indicates that it may have incremental validity. But a better way is to use [[Rejected: Does MHC have direct effects on medication use]].
