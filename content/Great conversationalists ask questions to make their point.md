# Great conversationalists ask questions to make their point
E.g. if someone makes a point they disagree with, they ask questions about it like:
* Oh, why is that so?
* How’d you come to that conclusion?

A large part of it is the degree of grace you use! E.g. Andy Matuschak’s “oh, I totally disagree!” while sounding super friendly.
