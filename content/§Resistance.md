# §Resistance
Resistance is the subjective emotion of finding something hard to stick with. It can arise when a task is either:
* 1) Not meaningful ([[Resistance arises when we don’t find actions valuable]]
* 2) Doesn't lead to progress ([[Resistance arises when we don’t perceive progress]]).

[[Explicitly recognise resistance]]

Q. How might we separate effort from resistance?
A. Resistance is lack of meaning or progress, effort is tackling difficulty.

## Backlinks
* [[§Effort]]
	* By effort, I mean the emotional state of doing something that’s difficult. That is separate from resistance ([[§Resistance]]), which is essentially lack of meaning/progress.
* [[§Difficulty]]
	* It is often accompanied by a feeling of effort ([[§Effort]]) and, given the circumstances, can result in resistance to the task ([[§Resistance]]).
* [[When am I working hard enough?]]
	* That means that there will be cases where I don’t desire working, and where I'll work anyway ([[§Determination]], [[§Effort]], [[§Resistance]]).
* [[A lack of effort signals a lack of growth]]
	* That doesn’t mean that you need effort all the time – sometimes you need to get the best out of what skills you already have. It also doesn’t mean that effort always signals growth – it might be part of [[§Resistance]] instead.
* [[What is my stance on duty?]]
	* These are often activities that we want to undertake; they're not duties in the "chore" sense of the word, but in the "doing what's important because it's the right thing to do" sense of the word. It makes me want to expend [[§Effort]] without [[§Resistance]].
