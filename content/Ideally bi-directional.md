# Ideally bi-directional
There are cases where I'd want to link in both directions, eg. where a general idea should become a priority for work as well ([[Learn touch-typing]]).

An alternative may be to promote those into the "life" domain â€“ they'll retain their links, but they can't be directly linked to.

Another question is how this affects the generation of the personal mnemonic medium. I'll have to test this before implementing.
