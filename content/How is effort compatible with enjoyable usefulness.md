# How is effort compatible with enjoyable usefulness
Luckily, activities are often enjoyable while being effortful – think gaming, running, learning something new. After all, [[Challenge is intrinsically motivating]]. 

Whether something is enjoyable, then, is probably largely a quality of the way you appraise the activity, how well it fits who you are right now etc. 

[[§Effort]], [[Enjoyable usefulness]].
