# §Emotions
Three main theories:
* [[§Appraisal]]
* [[§Basic Emotions]]
* [[§Psychological Construction]]

Emotions are, centrally, intuition about what actions need to happen for us to live by our values ([[Emotions are messengers]]). 

<!-- #p1 Integrate with “[[How Emotions are Made]]” -->

This means that they co-occur with lots of bodily changes, e.g. increasing heart rate and BP for running away from something.

* [[Emotions are emergent heuristics about actions for values]], just like more broadly, [[Intuition is emergent heuristics]].

* [[Intuition can be fooled]]
	* [[Intuition requires high validity]]
	* [[Intuition requires plentiful practice]]

This means that [[Emotions are important if they're helpful]]. Furthermore, emotions aren't who we are. They're only intuitions. This means we shouldn't fight them, but listen to and think about them, so that we can [[Align emotions and cognitions]] ([[Deliberate to validate emotions]]). 

Sometimes, we should even just let them be. 
	* [[Make room for your feelings when they become unhelpful]]

This helps us avoid: 
	* [[Struggling with emotions leads to problematic behavior]]
		* [[Thought and feeling control strategies worsen quality of life over the long term]]

However, it's still important to [[Use heuristics]] (see more reasons in the link)
	* [[Precision and speed are a trade-off]]
		* [[Use heuristics for prioritisation]]
	* [[Heuristics are low effort]]

Our stated values, then, are our model of our true values ([[All models are heuristics]], [[Deliberate about models]]).

## Backlinks
* [[Emotions are intuition that something is important]]
	* How, then, do we determine whether the emotions are valid? [[§Intuition]] can be validated by [[§Deliberation]] ([[Deliberate about models]]), so [[§Emotions]] can probably be validated by [[§Deliberation]] ([[Deliberate to validate emotions]]).
* [[Positive emotions remind us to savour what is important to us]]
	* [[§Emotions]], [[Emotions are intuition that something is important]]
