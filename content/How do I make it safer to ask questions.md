# How do I make it safer to ask questions?
Given the change from last semester, it appears that the change to zoom and maybe the lack of knowing your co-students is making it more anxiety-inducing to ask questions.

Why is that? (Notice the irony in asking the group, while we’ve just said it’s anxiety-provoking).

Ask co-teachers?

	* Probably something about the feeling of safety. How can we make it feel more safe to ask questions. 
	* Another is feeling like the question is irrelevant for the class
		* See the data – there is likely someone with the same question

One is to emphasise that you can ask questions in chat, and that asking me questions afterwards is also definitely allowed! I’ll stay for some minutes answering questions after class.
