This is problematic if 1) I’m going to use it for [[?Decrease lack of consistency in 12th sem. retrieval prompts]] and 2) The deficiences of cloze deletion prompts apply to the medical context that I will apply the information to.

When I’m using cloze deletions, it’s typically for information where conceptual knowledge will not solve the problem, e.g. which tests to order for some disease. In this case, conceptual knowledge can help through [[§Elaborative encoding]], but given the speed with which I need to produce the information, it’s rarely enough.

*Critiques*
* Cloze deletions typically include so much context that they allow for pattern matching/overfitting. This is less true if all it includes is a diagnosis and the items that are important to remember. It might also be possible to circumvent, at least somewhat, [[?Retrieval prompts should include (only) the context available at usage time]].

* Cloze deletions aren’t effortful to write, so they don’t induce as much [[§Elaborative encoding]]
	* This is both a pro and a con, though, it allows me to write many more prompts more quickly
	* For the type of prompts I’ll be replacing, this is only a pro

* Cloze deletions can cause problems with [[Retrieval prompts should permit only one answer]] - I’ve only rarely experienced this, but this might be due to the context given - which itself can induce the problem number one.
