# The Paradigm Shift in Rationality with Anna Riedl
See iCloud.

* The Efficiency Robustness trade-off, somewhat similar to the bias-variance trade-off. 
    * With limited information, having a simpler model (e.g. system 1) can be more accurate than a complex one.
    * Whereas with more data, more computation and higher model complexity leads to more information.
* As opposed to the speed vs. accuracy trade-off. 
    * Sometimes speed is worth it! [[Opportunity cost]].

This means we need to establish which information is relevant, and do so quickly.

* Simon's scissors?

* Combinatorial explosion - the frame problem, all possible sequences of behavior

* All possible ways of connecting long-term memory

Defining a problem is essential - e.g. how the problem was framed, as 'avoiding deaths' or 'saving lives' carries meaning in almost all real contexts,  for example social information. 

Framing effects, then, probably aren't biases in all situations. They're heuristics for determining how to relate to the world.

Self-knowledge is useful because it allows you to adjust your view based on your somewhat mis-aligned priors. E.g. if you know you're unenthusiastic on average, you can adjust your enthusiasm upwards.

[[§Wisdom]] is 
* Being good at [[§Prioritisation]], but in the most general sense. Wisdom is choosing what is important to you. 
* [[§Wisdom]] is realising what is not important, but also in the more specific sense - e.g. for a given problem, which factors matter?
