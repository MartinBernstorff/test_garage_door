Critical thinking, then, is [[System 2]] thinking. It's using reasoning and logic to derive what is true based on a given set of facts. 

* [[Analysis]]: Breaking something down into its component parts
* [[Inference]]:
	* Exploring causal networks to identify which lever to push for something to change. 
* [[Evaluation]]: Comparing evidence to modify your beliefs, eg. which of three possible causal networks best fit a given situation

They also include more general tendencies:
* The tendency to seek truth
* The tendency to be open minded

It can be measured by the "California Critical Thinking Skills Test".
