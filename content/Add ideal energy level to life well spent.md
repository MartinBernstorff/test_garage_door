# Add ideal energy level to life well spent
This will correlate highly with neutral-hour cost ratio (NHCR) – the amount of neutral-hours an activity costs divided by the duration of completing that activity. If NHCR is low, it's typically a rejuvenating activity.

That isn't the whole picture, though. Some activities that energy, but have low NHCR (e.g. strength training). Others take almost no energy, but have high NHCR (e.g. youtube). 

The activities I want for when I'm tired have 1) Low NHCR and 2) Low initial energy. For example:
1. Going for a walk
2. Meditating
3. Napping

You can add this to pory as well.

You probably want low, medium and high categories.
