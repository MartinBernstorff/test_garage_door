If doing the basics, consistently well, is one of the most foundational causes of success, what does this imply?

Firstly, that letting go of the basics is a terrible idea. Almost no matter the cost. However, I'm not sure how to make this into something actionable. 

Losing proactivity happens due to three reasons, all of which are motivated by being easier in the short term but more painful and less enjoyable in the long term:
1. Abdicating responsibility (it's someone else's fault, or there's nothing I can do about it)
2. [[Displacement activity]]
3. Hitting yourself over the head with your failures, without diagnosing what to do about them
