# MHC is likely valid
Does MHC have high interrater-reliability (yes, it's narrowly defined) and does it have appropriate test-retest reliability (probably, since the HBSC-SCL is decently reliable).

Whether it has "incremental validity", ie. whether it can usefully be its own concept is what I believe is left to explore.
