# Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering
The general thought is that it's hard to appreciate life when you're on the run and that negative affect can, although rarely, contain information relevant to how you want to live your ideal life ([[Negative affect can contain information]]).

We also tend to run into [[Thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems]], even as [[We have limited control over what we feel]].

[[A meaningful life contains discomfort]].

ACT is not about avoiding negative affect, it's about letting that negative affect be so that we can take valued action.

Instead, [[Make room for your feelings when they become unhelpful]] and [[Focus on your actions]], since they're relatively within your control.

Q. Why might evading negative affect lead to suffering?
A. 1) [[Thought and feeling control strategies are effective only in the short term]], 2) We miss out on many meaningful activities (since they are uncomfortable) and 3) We miss out on the growth of learning why an activity causes us negative affect
