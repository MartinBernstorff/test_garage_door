# Retrieval prompts should permit only one answer
* To compensate for [[Retrieval Induced Forgetting (RIFO)]], where the mechanism is likely through interference. In that sense, this is also a way of helping you clearly delineate concepts and cards.

* To keep it easy to rate whether you answered the question correctly or not, maintaining the efficiency of the scheduling algorithm

* To maintain clear feedback during your review sessions, keeping them more clear and engaging ([[Retrieval practice should be engaging]]).

Q. What is the impact on the subjective quality of your review sessions if cards permit more than one answer?
A. It adds ambiguity, which makes them more unpleasant.

Q. During SRS review, you notice that it’s ambiguous how you’re supposed to answer a question. Why is it detrimental to your future enjoyment of your review sessions if you mark it as correct?
A. Ambiguity is unpleasant, and it keeps the ambiguity in rotation.

Q. During SRS review, you notice that it’s ambiguous how you’re supposed to answer a question. How might keeping it in rotation negatively impact how accurately you rate other cards?
A. You accept greater ambiguity in ratings.

Cards that permit more than one answer worsen your memory via:
* {Weakened encoding}
* {[[Retrieval Induced Forgetting (RIFO)]]}

Depends on the type of thinking you do, can also induced [[Retrieval Induced Facilitation (RIFA)]].

Q. Why is it important that retrieval prompts produce only one answer?
A. 1) To avoid [[Retrieval Induced Forgetting (RIFO)]].

Q. Why should retrieval prompts produce the entire answer every time?
A. To avoid the parts of the answer you didn’t recall running into [[Retrieval Induced Forgetting (RIFO)]].

Q. When a retrieval prompt produces inconsistent answers, what happens to the memories which aren’t retrieved?
A. They’re inhibited

Q. During SRS review, you notice that it’s ambiguous how to answer one of your retrieval prompts. What are you going to do about it?
A. Does it feel interesting or important? If no, suspend. If yes, rephrase.
