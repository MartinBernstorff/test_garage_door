# §Saving
Why do we save things? To avoid doing the same thing twice. Any time you find that you’re repeating yourself, or repeating an action, consider whether you could save the results and just re-use them. 

Whether this is worthwhile depends on: 
* The benefit of saving the thing
	* The benefit of the thing
	* The probability of re-use
	* The cost of re-doing the thing
	* The look-up speed after you’ve saved

* The cost of saving the thing
	* Cost of space
		* Sorting/search overhead, both for the item itself, but even more importantly, for the other items in the set!
