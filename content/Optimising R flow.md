# Optimising R flow
* Move as much of the code as possible into external scripts
	- Knit everything to check that it works
	- Can I use "source" to run code, even though it's not in functions?
	- Split code into relevant .rmd files
		- subchapter_props
		- individual_unique_diagnoses
		- stability_connected_series

*Pain points*
* Forgot to leave breadcrumbs when I left for tea
	* Allow to leave breadcrumbs in Time Out
		* I can now, but I don't know how to access them well. 
		* Can I add a "quick note" for each break automatically?
		* Can I use the other Pomodoro app, "R" something instead?

* Naming of files is ambiguous when looking at VSCode tab names
