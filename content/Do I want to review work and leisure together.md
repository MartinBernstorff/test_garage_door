# Do I want to review work and leisure together
I think so! Part of spending time well is [[Â§Prioritisation]], and that requires that I can compare my options. 

One of those major comparisons is work and leisure. It's about helping [[Separate work and recreation in day to day]] (to make use of [[Compartmentalisation helps focus]]), while still being able to make the best possible decisions for prioritisation (i.e. "work/recreation balance").

It also makes maintenance of LWS easier.
