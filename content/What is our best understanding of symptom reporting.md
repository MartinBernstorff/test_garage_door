# What is our best understanding of symptom reporting?
[file:7D3ABCBB-2927-4347-8CF8-A0A3D539BAAE-11123-000022031C110F04/J.W. Pennebaker - The Psychology of Physical Symptoms-Springer-Verlag (1982).pdf]

Encoding -> Awareness -> Reporting 
Each can be influenced by different factors. 

When we get cues:
1. Orienting, or competition of cues
2. Schemas and selective search
3. Inference

Much information is processed subconsciously, eg. Adam 1980 balloon in ileum experiment.

Awareness of symptoms is a function of internal receptor stimulation, external information, and beliefs we hold that cause us to select which information is important. 

This explains, in part, why we enjoy exercise more (and work harder) if we have to focus on something other than the exercise itself. This flips around as you reach the elite level, where elite runners use internal awareness to regulate systems (Carver 1981). 

Symptom perception is least likely when we are adequately (but not too) challenged – it results in low autonomic activity, but high awareness of external stimuli (Person-environment fit, Pennebaker 1979).

Reporting is based on reenforcement, or self-image concerns (appearing weak vs. not being ill enough for treatment).

Two interesting theories so far:
*Cognitive attribution*; if we don’t know what our perceptions mean, we mirror the interpretations of those around us – eg. we interpret stomach ache as dangerous if our parents do so.

Perception + worry -> Symptom contact
