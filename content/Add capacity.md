# Add capacity
This should be the last resort; if we want to do it well, we have to measure it, but adding a metric to it also tends to cause problems, see [[Quantification decreases intrinsic motivation]] and [[Quantification decreases enjoyment]]. 

Automation is a very good alternative! It requires some upfront investment, but can pay tremendous dividends.

Ensure that the constraint is running as much of the time as possible, eg. pay for overtime, [[Offload]] etc.

As a last resort, you can hire more people or buy more machines.
