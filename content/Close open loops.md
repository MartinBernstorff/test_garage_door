# Close open loops
We need some way of closing open loops, eg. that small misc. things that *needs* to get done by a given deadline, but that you don’t really want to remember or think about. You just want it done.

Another, better method is probably to just let the task be, if it isn’t ever going to the top of [[Impact Density Scheduling]] - either through pure density or [[Priority inheritance]]

	* I probably want to add these small tasks to the daily plan, so that I remember them and [[Close open loops]], without getting distracted by doing the activity right now. That is one of the major advantages of [[Daily planning in a daily working log]], it is such low [[§Friction]] that you can do that without a large loss to overhead.
