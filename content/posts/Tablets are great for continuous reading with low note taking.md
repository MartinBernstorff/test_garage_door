# Tablets are great for continuous reading with low note taking
Research is great on the computer – looking for the right type of evidence to answer a given question.

Reading is great on the tablet, leaning back, thinking and taking notes, avoiding [[Tablets are poor for browsing]] and [[Tablets are poor for scientific writing]].

One implication of this may be that I want to split my research and reading tags up, given that [[Prefer work in the right mental state]] – I've incorporated it into [[$My note system]].

Q. Why are tablets good for reading?
A. Harder to do context switching than on computers, reading can be done in more comfortable contexts.

Q. Which disadvantages do tablets have for serious reading?
A. Poorer note-taking ability due to poorer text input and slower screenshot work flow.
