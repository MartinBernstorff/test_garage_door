# Collaboration speeds up problem solving
Since we can build on each others solutions and each devote time, quickly climbing the hill to a local optimum.

However, if you are one of the quicker ones, you will climb more slowly to the local optimum.

Numbers on graph are number of rounds. After eg. the second round, CT (constant teamwork) significantly outperforms the other areas on # of correct solution legs.

	* From [[Bernstein 2018]], shows that if we’re looking to find the optimum solution, ability to refer to previous solutions is not necessarily a good idea. However, in real-world scenarios we often want to [[Increase reusability]] because the solutions we have are adequate. Furthermore, speed is often way more important than finding the optimal solution – eg. producing a computer is way more important than finding the best way of producing a computer. Collaboration and storage work way better for speed, [[Collaboration speeds up problem solving]].

	* Given that [[Collaboration speeds up problem solving]], and the graph, should I ask for help as early in the problem solving process as possible?
