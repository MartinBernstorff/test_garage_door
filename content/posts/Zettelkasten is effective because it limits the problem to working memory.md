# Zettelkasten is effective because it limits the problem to working memory
Essentially avoiding memory overflow. Makes it easier to keep the problem in working memory, so that the last free chunks can be swapped out quickly from long-term memory and compared to the problem â€“ this means that we can draw associations much faster.
