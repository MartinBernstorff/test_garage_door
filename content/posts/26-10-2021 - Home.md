*How do I feel?*
A little tired, could probably use a short nap. Maybe that's the first thing to get done.

I'm pretty certain that my [[Vision for Work: Private Sector, Data-science]] is the best vision for me. This makes me tremendously motivated, and makes it obvious where I need to spend my energy to get good.

*Plan*
- Write ckruse, [[Mail to Christian Kruse, 26\/10\/2021]]
* Høre Pernille om lørdag/søndag
* Evt. en dag i ugen også
* Game a bit
