# When is being idle a waste of time
An example of [[Skinner’s Razor]] – one way of becoming more productive is to make it more unpleasant to do nothing, essentially to cultivate [[§Boredom]]. 

Being idle is helpful if: 
1. Producing more overloads bottlenecks or 
2. You need rest because you’re overwhelmed. 

?Otherwise, it’s a waste of time. 

One danger of cultivating such a stance is that it becomes hard to relax at all. If your default response to idleness is to look for things to do, it might become increasingly hard to do nothing.
