# A strong vision enables a great life
This goes for most areas of life.

A vision should contain clarity about what you want to achieve, why you want to achieve it, and how to go about getting there.

This is different from a plan; a plan is more rigid, a series of steps. A vision is an outline, and somewhere you want to go. It is easier to change, but still offers direction, helping you to let go of [[Displacement activity]] in favour of something more meaningful.

Some examples of these:
* [[§My High-Level Vision for My Life]]
	* [[§My Vision for a Partnership]]
		* [[§My Vision of Myself as a Partner]]
		* [[§My Vision of My Partner]]
			* [[A day in my ideal partnership]]
			* [[Which activities do I want to do regularly with a partner]]
	* [[§My Ideal Work]]
	* [[§My Ideal Parenthood]]
