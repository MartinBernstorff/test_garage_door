# Strategies for being in doubt about children
[[Uncertainty can be draining]]. It means that getting out of this state (ie. achieving certainty) is a primary priority.

For young people, the decision has to be made under large uncertainty. You don't want the children /right now/, but you do want to be in a relationship that you think will fulfill your values. This means that [[LTRs are challenged by goal conflict]], and that you want to explore whether having children is necessary to live by your values. If not, that may be a solution to the problem.

For the time when you're in doubt:

Decision-strategies:
[[Make a decision now]]

If you're uncertain about whether you'll attain more certainty, it makes sense to postpone the decision. However, [[Uncertainty can be draining]], so you want the strategy that drains you the least.

This is probably the strategy that prompts thinking about separation the least. You want to frame the question as "how certain are we about children", given that you're certain about the above.

You can postpone whether you want to think/talk about the decision, and you can postpone the decision itself.
[[Postpone consideration based on calendar time]]
[[Postpone consideration based on milestones]]

The decision itself:
[[Postpone decision based on calendar time]]
[[Postpone decision based on milestones]]

Emotion-strategies:
[[Attain detachment]]
[[Stay attached]]
