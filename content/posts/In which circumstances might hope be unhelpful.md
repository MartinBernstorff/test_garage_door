That’s when it makes is expend resources on activities with negative expected value, when it makes us stick with something instead of redirecting our efforts, or when it draws focus towards something that we have no control over ([[Hope is problematic when it’s unrealistic]], [[Hope is problematic when we cannot act on it]]).
