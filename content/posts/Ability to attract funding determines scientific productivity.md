# Ability to attract funding determines scientific productivity
Interacts with [[Work on the right problems]]. If you can't get funded, you can't be productive.

Also, the more time you spend on attracting funding, the less time you spend doing work.

And, the more funding you attract, the more you can afford to pay collaborators to do more of the work. This interacts with [[Interpersonal skills determine scientific productivity]], and essentially means that there is no cap to the value of this either.

It's highly analogous to a more general tenet, [[Persistence determines scientific productivity]].

How, then, do we get good at attracting funding? What do funders look for?

It definitely matters to: 
* Apply the right places
* Apply enough places
* Write good grant applications
