*How am I feeling today?*
Very good! Spending time with Pernille and her family yesterday felt awesome, and I love contributing to something.

I’m still not quite sure what we are or where we’re going, so that’s likely at the top of the list for today.

Very happy with using Nobelparken as an area for thinking deeply and doing work where I don’t want to be distracted; this works really well, especially in the sense that my poor habits around computers are diluted by being in a new context. I want to make use of this as much as possible in the future, which increases the value of having a good mobile setup.
