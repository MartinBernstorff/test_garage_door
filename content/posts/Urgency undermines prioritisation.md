# Urgency undermines prioritisation
> results from five experiments demonstrate that people are more likely to perform unimportant tasks (i.e., tasks with objectively lower payoffs) over important tasks (i.e., tasks with objectively better payoffs)

One reason for this may be a heuristic; it contains the uncertainty reduction of getting urgent tasks done quickly.

This implies that avoiding urgency, unless it's true and with a high pay-off, is important for prioritisation.

However, true and perceived urgency probably improve motivation ([[Urgency motivates us]]).

In that sense, urgency is probably like goal-setting â€“ it increases focus and effort, but decreases flexibility and exploration.
