# Balancing WIP increases joy
As humans, we like to complete things! When we have less WIP, we [[Decrease lag time]], which makes the project more likely to be relevant and more likely to be succesful. This increases joy.

On the other hand, we also like variety in our lives, to do things that keep our lives interesting. Balancing WIP, then, is what matters.

Q. Why might we want to balance WIP?
