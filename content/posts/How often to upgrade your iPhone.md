# How often to upgrade your iPhone
[[Before buying a used phone \/ iPhone]]

* What are the “transaction costs” - time?
		* Roughly 5 attention-hours
	* How much more expensive is it to buy a better phone, but then have a slower upgrade cycle?
		* Assuming linear cycles
			* iPhone 8 - 1.300 - 600 p.a.
			* iPhone X - 1.900 - 600 p.a.
			* iPhone XS - 2.400 - 500 p.a.
			* iPhone 11 - 3.300 - 900 p.a.
			* iPhone 12 - 4.000 - 700 p.a.
	* Risk of dropping it is constant
	* Is it better to just use heuristics for this?
