# Davidsen review
Dear Davidsen et al. 

Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting article. You examine the association between parental severe mental illness and the offspring’s diagnoses. Furthermore, you examine whether these associations differ by outcome diagnosis (somatic/psychiatric, or specific diagnoses).

As a general comment, I was unsure about whether your analyses are to be interpreted as causal/counterfactually predictive, predictive or maybe a third category? For more on this terminology, see “A classification of data science tasks” from [Hernan et al](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1268/1268/20/hernan_chance19.pdf).

I will return to the implications of this below.

*Abstract*
/The risk of anxiety/OCD and attachment disorder among offspring exposed to parental, and in particular maternal, SMI was markedly raised with IRR for anxiety/OCD=17.02 (12.80-19.57) and attachment disorders=15.40 (12.91-18.38) for maternal schizophrenia/
This sentence starts as a generality on parental SMI, but ends with specifically maternal schizophrenia. Is it SMI->Anxiety and Maternal schizophrenia->Attachment disorders?



Absolute counts?

Given that “our analyses are explorative”, the wording in the conclusion may be too strong and may not follow from the current study.

SMI defined as either schizophrenia, bipolar disorders or depressive disorders.

Is there an equivalent to a “table 1”, ie. a table with baseline demographics?

Why adjust for the given variables?

Which diagnoses carry the age-difference in psychiatric disorders? How good is the diagnostic precision of those diagnoses? (Ie. to which extent may it be explained by increased sensitivity from the diagnostician due to parental disease?)

Do they count the A-diagnosis or any diagnosis? (Eg. for “ill-defined symptoms”, R10 is the typical a-diagnosis for appendicitis)

"As hypothesized, maternal SMI resulted in higher IRRs of child psychiatric disorders than paternal SMI, pointing to the contributing role of the early caregiving environment in developing psychopathology.  

Premature birth as a confounder?

*Limitations*
Selection-problems – probably none, except depression diagnoses with GP, both of exposure and outcome. Important for external validity. 

Confunding – depends on whether they want to interpret causally, which they do seem to do in their clinical implications.
