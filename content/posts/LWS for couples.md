# LWS for couples
The idea is like LWS, but allows for coordination of couple-preferences over a day.

I think the ideal flow is something like:
1. Both decide on the activities they would like to do for the day, and assigns them ratings
2. The other person is shown the list (with the ratings hidden), and then can rate those as well
3. Finally, the activities with the highest multiplied ratings can be selected from

Afterwards, activities are rated like in LWS, to create a "couples activities" list.

Some thoughts:
1. Can I keep this list synced with my personal LWS?
	1. Probably only through Integromat, but that should be possible! â€“ automatically add to the log (and automatically add ratings in the other direction)
