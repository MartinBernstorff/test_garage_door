# §My systems
These are the instantiations of [[How do I balance think-research-read-do-experience]].

Much of this is instantiated in [[$My note system]], which then further consists of:

* [[$My thinking system]]
	* [[§Principles for improving thinking]]
	* [[When to prioritise ideation]]

* [[$My research system]]
	* [[§Principles for improving on research]]
	* [[When to prioritise research]]

* [[§My optional execution system]]

* [[§My execution system]]
	* [[§Principles for improving execution]]
	* [[When to prioritise execution]]

* [[$My reading system]]
	* [[Principles for improving reading]]
	* [[When to prioritise reading]]

* [[$My experience system]]
	* [[Principles for improving experiences]]
	* [[When to prioritise savouring]]

However, remember that [[Better systems miss the point, what we want is better action]].

## Backlinks
* [[$My activity types]]
	* Elaborated on in [[§My systems]].
* [[Freedom, not forcing]]
	* Good use of [[§My systems]] seems like being liberated; it externalises an obligation so you don't have to worry about it. It doesn't seem constricting – it's someone helping you out, not someone forcing you to stay on task.
