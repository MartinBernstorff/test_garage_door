# Focus on what you would like to do more of
If you feel like you’re spending your time poorly, it’s easy to focus on doing less of something - less gaming, less surfing etc. That’s where the problem lies, right?

But you can’t be spending too much time on something without having something else you’d rather do. After all, time stops for no man, it’ll pass whether you’re doing something or not.

It’s also much more motivating to think about what you’d like to do! It can become part of your [[§Vision]]. 

Q. Why is it better to focus on what you’d like to do more of, rather than how to minimise distractions?
A. 
1. Distractions will always be available, 
2. Approach ([[§Vision]]]]) is more motivating
