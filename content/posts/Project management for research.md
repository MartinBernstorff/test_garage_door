# Project management for research
One example is basecamp. It’s about how to [[Optimise the academic feedback cycle]]. 

The problem I’m trying to solve is:
* I wait for feedback, increasing WIP
	* Our meeting can be even leaner
	* I avoid asking for feedback to avoid overflowing email inboxes
* It can be hard to reference previous decisions, eg. what did we decide on XY meeting
	* although it is rare that this is a problem
* I don’t have a place to share pitches without overwhelming you with emails

## Backlinks
* [[Do we want synchronous or asynchronous communication for research ideas?]]
	* This leans against [[Project management for research]], and is an essential part of [[§Technology for the betting table]].
