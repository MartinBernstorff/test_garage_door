# 2022 - Homely
<!-- #hp -->

This year is all about:
* Setting up the new apartment so that it’s
	* Nice for me to live in now
	* Reasonable for a family
	* Re-sellable

* Deepening my relationship with Pernille. She’s smart as hell, and while not perfect, she’s pretty close!

* Furthering my career, and being of service. Getting a publication out with basic models is of utmost importance!

Maybe write this like a letter from my future self?
