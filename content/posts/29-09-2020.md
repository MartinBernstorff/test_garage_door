Pretty good day all in all. Started the day a little late, so there’s potential for adding capacity, something I think I’d want to do. I can do that by doing a “trucker” shower in the morning, especially since it’s almost only me at work.

Prepping for teaching was pretty good! Nothing much to say there. 

I also feel I got the most out of the time in between teaching that I could; doing small misc. tasks as well as collating which information I have on Theory of Constraints.
