# Do I want as intense hedonism as possible
Since [[MIL is fun]] and I have decent mechanisms for adjusting overrun ([[Complice.co]], [[Beeminder]]), does this imply to make those as enjoyable as possible as well? Eg. [[Do I want to play FPS games]]? 

On the one hand, that’ll be more intense and most likely more fun. 

On the other hand, it dramatically ups the addictiveness potential, but that can be (at least somewhat) balanced via Beeminder ([[Do I want to play FPS games]]).

It’ll also probably induce competition with relaxation. Many hedonic activities that are very intense also aren’t relaxing – excluding nature documentaries etc. This intensity does take your mind off of work, though.
