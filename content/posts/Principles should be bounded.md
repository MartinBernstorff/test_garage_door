# Principles should be bounded
Eg. for [[Balance WIP]], WIP is too high if you have a hard time focusing.

What might this look like for general life principles? #p1 

How bounded? As little as possible to facilitate [[Far transfer]], as much as necessary to avoid overgeneralisation. (Maybe add a prompt of this as well).

Q. What is a typical failure mode for principles?
A. Their application is unbounded 

Q. Why might unbounded principles be problematic?
A. They encourage over-generalisation
