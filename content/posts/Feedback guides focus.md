# Feedback guides focus
Probably via somewhat the same mechanisms as [[Goal setting increases focus]].

## Backlinks
* [[Â§Feedback]]
	* How does it work?
	\* [[Systems have three states]]
* [[Get exclusively high validity feedback]]
	* Since [[Feedback guides focus]], getting non-valid feedback means we'll focus on and try to improve things that don't matter. This means that we need to [[Filter feedback]], to avoid focusing on the wrong things.
