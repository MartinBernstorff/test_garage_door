# What are the advantages of ML?

Can process different data types and questions:

	1	Machine learning may well deliver better results for questions you're already asking about data you already have, simply as an analytic or optimization technique. For example, our portfolio company Instacart  [built a system](https://tech.instacart.com/deep-learning-with-emojis-not-math-660ba1ad6cdc)  to optimize the routing of its personal shoppers through grocery stores that delivered a 50% improvement (this was built by just three engineers, using Google's open-source tools Keras and Tensorflow).

	2	Machine learning lets you ask new questions of the data you already have. For example, a lawyer doing discovery might search for 'angry’ emails, or 'anxious’ or anomalous threads or clusters of documents, as well as doing keyword searches,

	3	Third, machine learning opens up new data types to analysis - computers could not really read audio, images or video before and now, increasingly, that will be possible.

Can automate new things, eg. recognizing a wrinkle. what would you do if you had a million fifteen year olds to look at your data? What calls would you listen to, what images would you look at, and what file transfers or credit card payments would you inspect?

That is, this not so much a thousand interns as one intern that’s very very fast, and you give your intern 10 million images and they come back and say ‘it’s a funny thing, but when I looked at the third million images, this pattern really started coming out’. So, what fields are narrow enough that we can tell an ML system the rules (or give it a score), but deep enough that looking at /all/ of the data, as no human could ever do, might bring out new results?
