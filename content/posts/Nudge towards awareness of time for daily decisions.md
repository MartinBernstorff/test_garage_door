# Nudge towards awareness of time for daily decisions
I think my best idea so far is a 24-hour clock with sleep times marked. This has a bunch of advantages:

* It indicates the circularity of days; that no failure is permanent
* It can show how much time I have left
* Time is constant and visual – no “2 to 4 vs 6 to 8” abstractions. 
	* You can easily visualise amounts of time.
