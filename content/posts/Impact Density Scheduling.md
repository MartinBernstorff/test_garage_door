# Impact Density Scheduling
This appears to be what we do naturally, and apparently there’s empirical evidence that it’s what animals do.

Remember that effects are dynamic, e.g. as risk of missing a deadline increases, if missing the deadline is costly, the impact of doing a task is higher.

The more time we spend determining something’s impact density, the higher the overhead. This means that improving [[§Prioritisation]] improves our overall lives.

## Backlinks
* [[§Prioritisation]]
	* Maybe this isn’t quite right, though? [[Impact Density Scheduling]] uses the importance of a task to sort them for execution, somewhat similarly to [[§Selection]]. However, [[§Selection]] is a [[Bucket Sort]], so it might improve the overall efficiency anyway.
* [[§Scheduling for a single agent]]
	* Moderately complicated scheduling problems are often intractable, unless we allow for [[Preemption]] - the ability to stop a task mid-way through and switch to another. This returns [[Impact Density Scheduling]] to the top – if you get another option, and it’s better than the current one, simply switch to that. 
* [[§How I schedule tasks]]
	* I do a combination of [[Just in time (JIT)]] and [[Impact Density Scheduling]].
	* I want to maximise my total throughput. This means [[Impact Density Scheduling]], with an adjustment for [[Neutral hour]]. 
* [[§Scheduling algorithms for a single agent]]
	* [[Impact Density Scheduling]]: Do the task with the highest impact density (effect / duration) first. 
	* [[§Procrastination]] can be seen as a strategy to [[Close open loops]] – you do the small tasks first, so you can get them off your mind. Another, better method is probably to just let the task be, if it isn’t ever going to the top of [[Impact Density Scheduling]] - either through pure density or [[Priority inheritance]]
* [[Stress and queues]]
	* Does stress happen when we’re queued too deep? When we feel we must maximise throughput of items ([[Shortest Processing Time]]), rather than [[Impact Density Scheduling]]? Or when we’re worried there will be dire consequences if we don’t get everything done?
* [[16-Dec-21 - Work]]
	* *How am I feeling today?*
* [[Daily batch of emails]]
	* This allows me to be sure not to miss anything, while also minimizing the amount of mobile phone checking. This is essentially a version of [[Impact Density Scheduling]].
