# Curate inflow of information
[[Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is]]. We therefor need to manage how much we do it, and calibrate on whether the stuff we collect is useful. The point is to [[Increase novelty-to-noise ratio]].

*Strategies:*
* [[Note down why you marked something as readable]].

This is analogous to [[How do I best handle the continuing stream of inklings]], but for information from outside my own head.

Andy’s approach here is to use an inbox and conscious decision-making. This feels good to me, since it’s self-directed and leverages intuition.

OTOH, it might increase friction a bit too much, especially because it feels “destructive” to let something go. I imitate this via the [[§Incremental thinking]] and p0.
