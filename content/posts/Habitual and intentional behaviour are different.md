For a popcorn-based example of this, see [[Neal 2011]]

	* Two primary categories, intentional and habitual, which require different approaches, see [[Habitual and intentional behaviour are different]].
* [[How might gaming relate to an unhelpful belief]]
	* That is definitely the case of gaming, which is strongly habituating ([[Habitual and intentional behaviour are different]]). It does have good sides, however, so ta total "ban" is not a good idea ([[§Gaming upsides]]). 
* [[Instrumentality decreases intrinsic motivation]]
	* However, you do want to notice whether you’re actually having fun, so that you can let go of behaviours that are habituating without being enjoyable ([[Habitual and intentional behaviour are different]], [[When having clarified values, put in habits in service of those values]]) and so you can [[Savour life]]. This requires noticing without judgement.
