# Memorising detailed facts allows for flexibility at usage time
As compared to making retrieval prompts of analysis, comparisons etc. 

If these facts are not at the same level of abstraction as the question you’re trying to answer, it requires that these facts can be combined to make causal inferences about what matters ([[Work at the right level of abstraction]]). However, this is a general criterion for facts to be useful.

This implies that, if we don’t know how we are going to use this knowledge at learning time, we want the representations to be as high detail and as flexible as possible.
