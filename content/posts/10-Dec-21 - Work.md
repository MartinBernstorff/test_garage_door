# 10-Dec-21 - Work
*How am I feeling?*
Very good! Nothing much in the form of resistance, and very ready to get some work done. Primarily, this means moving [[§Diagnosestabilitet på tværs af LPR2->LPR3]] forward. 

A little dubious about whether I'm getting a good price for [[Vestervang 34, 1 mf]]. There has been a sale at the 4th floor in august for 1.9, and if the interior is not terrible, that is a great price compared to this one. 

Not sure which actions this imply, though. I can wait longer and see, but I doubt that'll give me a substantially better deal. As such, I'm sticking to the plan.

*Agenda*
- Prep for Journal Club

- Work on [[§Diagnosestabilitet på tværs af LPR2->LPR3]]
	- Add new results to manuscript
	* Add text to the manuscript describing/explaining the new results.

* Sende paper-github til Helene/Jacob?

* Misc. small stuff

## Backlinks
* [[9-Dec-2021 - Review]]
	* For learning to improve, I might be able to stream straight to Twitch, and use that during my daily review. Definitely worthwhile, but will compromise data safety. [[10-Dec-21 - Work]]
