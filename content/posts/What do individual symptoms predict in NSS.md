# What do individual symptoms predict in NSS
Charlotte is interested in this because it may be “hypothesis-generating”. What does that mean? 

Probably something along the lines of it indicating which symptoms GPs are most worried about, and which symptoms may be associated across expectations – eg. headache associated to psychiatric disease.

Also, non-specific symptoms may be an indicator of the severity of disease. If we look at a set of diseases, eg. Schizophrenia, the symptoms may be predictive of how much treatment you need.
