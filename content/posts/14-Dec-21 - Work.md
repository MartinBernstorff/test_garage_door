# 14-Dec-21 - Work
*How am I feeling today?*
Very good! A little more work to implement bookdown than expected, but probably still worth it, especially in terms of the learning I'll get from it.

* [[LPR2->LPR3]]
	- 	Can I run bookdown chapters in parallel?
		- Use "job" for R

	- Get bookdown to run completely
		- Use a flag to determine whether to run all intervals for `individual-unique_diagnoses`

	- Opdatere forl√∏bskoder udfra Bettinas overvejelser

	- New branch for other tasks

	- Full bookdown run
	- Update manuscript with new results

* Flashcards

- To speed up code running, save the results you're about to plot to a .csv if allowed - can we do that?
