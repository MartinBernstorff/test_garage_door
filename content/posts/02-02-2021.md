I want to feel calm, to look at my emotions and allow them to pass, to take valuable action in spite of uncomfortable emotions.

I also want to feel my passions strongly, so that's why Aro meditation can be used as a substitute for TMI.

The first exercise from Aro was quite enjoyable – just practicing non-attachment, while staying alert. It allowed me to let some current worry about Mieke and I be, and it allowed me to let go of some worry and clinging.

In a sense, it also allowed me to fall in love with myself again. That even though I want something that I'm not sure is right (to be alone), and even though Mieke and I's relationship is good, I might want to let it go. That may mean suffering for a while, it may mean regret, it may mean I'll never find a relationship as good as this one. But it'll all be OK. Maybe that's what I enjoyed – the sense that all will be OK.
