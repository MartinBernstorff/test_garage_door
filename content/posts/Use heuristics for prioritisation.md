Since prioritising between all possible combinations requires that we list every single one on all possible dimensions, it’s an impossible problem.

Instead, use heuristics. For open-ended problems, what matters is not “is this the most important thing I can do”, but rather is this an important thing.

Which type of activity ([[$My activity types]]) to do depends largely on the type of day. 

Experience, though, can be cued in by stress. Since we know that mindfulness is typically de-stressing, if I have a hard time with something, adding in more experience is definitely a good idea.

This is similar as [Purpose | Meaningness](https://meaningness.com/purpose).

Another open question here is [[When to prioritise reading]], and the others.

One addition to this is, [[George Mack on Razors]]

Q. Why might we want to use heuristics in prioritisation?
A. Heuristics simplify the problem so we can make a choice.

Q. You have a decision to make, but you’re unsure about what to do. Which question would Jeff Bezos ask?
A. Will I regret not doing this?
