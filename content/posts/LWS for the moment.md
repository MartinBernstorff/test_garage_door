# LWS for the moment
Might it be worth it to decide which leisure-activities to do in the moment? 

If so, might a tinder-like interface for activities be worth it?

When starting an activity, open it full screen and then do that activity?

The two questions I need to answer is:
1. Is the activity good?
	1. Do I typically think spending time on this is time well spent
2. Is the activity appropriate?
	1. Energy
		1. Mental
		2. Physical
	2. Time

This would also allow for a greater collection of data â€“ e.g. if this activity was selected when *energy is low* and *time is < 15 min*, did I enjoy it?
