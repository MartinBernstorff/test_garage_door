# Note down why you marked something as readable
This acts as a stepping stone into a train of thought and, maybe even more importantly, it acts as a feedback loop for refining your curiosity ([[If you define the menu, you shape the choices]], [[Guiding exploration is necessary due to infinite paths]]). 

You answer a simple question; will I regret not reading this?

Or, if you need to interrogate your gut further, is this likely to provide [[§Deep Novelty]] or help manifest a [[§Vision]]? These questions are strongly aligned with what matters to you.

Another concern is that this makes it less fun not only to collect, but also to read. Beware of only noting down questions about utility - curiosity is just as valid!

Much of the stuff I encounter is interesting for [[§Int. Meandering]]'s sake. How do I handle that? #p0 

How do I write these notes? Question or source in title?

## Implementation
If I am going to do this well, it must be low friction and allow linking between notes. This implies that:

* iOS: A shortcut that a) Creates a bear note with the link, b) Opens that note so I can add context
* Mac: Nothing much - maybe get “new bear note” into muscle memory
* Windows: Not possible at the moment. However, if I really want to note something down, I can just do it on my iPhone.
