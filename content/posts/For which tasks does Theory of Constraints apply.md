# For which tasks does Theory of Constraints apply
[[Theory of Constraints]].

And under which circumstances does it not?

Q. In which situations does the Theory of Constraints apply?
A. When a process is repeated with multiple, independent resources in sequence.

[[Does ToC apply if work can be completed in parallel]]

To generalise to academic work, you can identify bottlenecks at the department/group level.

Q. When does Theory of Constraints not apply?
A. 1. For work with only one resource or 2. For the smallest unit of work: you can't identify a bottleneck, since work units can't pile up. (But you can use CCPM ([[CCPM]]).

Q. In which situations can we not identify a bottleneck?
A. Workflows with only one resource, or where there are not multiple units of work that can pile up.

But bottleneck analysis comes with multiple optimization suggestions, which apply even for a project with purely sequential steps. And given that all projects can be delayed by waiting for a resource, optimizing where there's the most potential is definitely beneficial – even if it isn't technically bottleneck analysis.

[[Identify general principles for optimization]]

a project requires j there are multiple resources that can be active at the same time.

It depends on the perspective. If I have a project that requires multiple people to work on it, but they can't work on it in parallel, critical chain is better suited for it.

Probably useful to make flashcards of.

How does this relate to having multiple ideas, and churning them through a flow? It probably doesn't, unless you're certain that you want to complete every idea.

In that sense, the Theory of Constraints is about optimizing for a specific goal. Say you want to implement as many ideas as possible; then you can identify your constraint in that flow.

Say you want to complete as many nobel-laureate level ideas as possible. This most likely switches the constraint further down the chain; the constraint becomes the quality of your ideas.

<!-- #research Why does this not match with Tiago Fortes interpretation?       -->

If Tiago's tenet that mental resources are at least somewhat independent (ie. that you only have limited ideation/learning/execution resources), then the theory holds.

Even if that isn't the case, you do have limited time resources. So you can use ToC to identify where your time is best invested, given your current goals.
