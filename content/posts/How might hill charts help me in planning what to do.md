# How might hill charts help me in planning what to do?
The purpose of hill charts is to visualise at which point in the process you are – are you discovering, shaping the work, or are you executing it.

Knowing that there are still a bunch of unknowns means you need to do more thinking to accurately estimate whether your appetite ([[Set the appetite]]) for the project matches the work to be done.

[[Hill charts]] are mostly useful for communicating. When communicating with yourself, they might be useful. It’s can become part of the [[§Problem solving]] vocabulary.

It also helps with which challenges to tackle first - problems you’re uncertain about need to go to the top of the hill as fast as possible, so that you can encounter critical uncertainties early [[Quality check at low value]].
