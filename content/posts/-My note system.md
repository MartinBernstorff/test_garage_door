# $My note system
This interacts with [[$My personal mnemonic medium]].

## Backlinks
* [[§Incremental thinking]]
	* This is an improvement to [[$My note system]].
* [[§My systems]]
	* Much of this is instantiated in [[$My note system]], which then further consists of:
* [[Do I want to switch to Bear]]
	* A possible improvement on [[$My note system]].
* [[$My research production process]]
	* It all starts with a new idea or a new problem, typically arisen from [[$My note system]]. This is then developed into a more mature research idea:
* [[Extract tags with context from notes to Airtable]]
	* This is an extension of [[$My note system]], allowing weighted random prompts to be sent to me via some system. It's a general implementation of the [[$Self-recommendations]], but now not only for things to read, but for actions more broadly.
* [[Automate git-syncing for lessons files]]
	* [[$My note system]]
	* [[$My note system]]
* [[Note titles should work as APIs]]
	* [[$My note system]]
* [[Tablets are great for continuous reading with low note taking]]
	* One implication of this may be that I want to split my research and reading tags up, given that [[Prefer work in the right mental state]] – I've incorporated it into [[$My note system]].
* [[Run note scripts once a day]]
	* [[$My note system]]
* [[Add a streak like function]]
	* To [[$My note system]] and [[§Incremental thinking]]. Something like if I edit a note I'd like to do more work on very soon, add #promoted hashtag. If a card has that hashtag, it has 100% chance of being selected. If it is passed over, the tag is removed.
* [[Add more emphasis on the reading and research of material connected to notes]]
	* This is to support [[Building requires repeated attention]] through [[$My reading system]] and [[$My note system]]. Currently, much of what I do is not connected to anything previous. And some of the most interesting things I have are associated with something I've selected previously, eg. the Kahnemann paper. 
* [[Add support for activity category]]
	* This is an improvement to [[$My note system]], which enables [[Keep activity possibilities salient without an inbox]].
* [[Allow interlinking, but separate work and leisure]]
	* [[$My note system]]
* [[Can I get around the Google drive usage by symlinking between work and leisure accounts on Mac?]]
	* Can I get around the Google drive usage by symlinking between work and leisure accounts on Mac?  [[$My note system]]
* [[How do I avoid subjects being demoted while being edited]]
	* [[$My note system]]
* [[Make promote curve steeper]]
	* [[$My note system]]
* [[Migrate from Hazel to bash plus Keyboard Maestro]]
	* [[$My note system]]
* [[Separate reading and research]]
	* This is an improvement to [[Keeping media salient without inboxes]] that I would like do. [[$My note system]]
* [[When do I want to think without writing]]
	* [[$My note system]].
