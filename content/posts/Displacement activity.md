# Displacement activity
På dansk: Overspringshandling.

These are self-soothing activities that people and animals exhibit when they are highly motivated for multiple activities or don't know which activities to undertake, e.g. scratching your head or checking facebook.

The abovementioned problem is best solved by seeking out more information and/or deliberating ([[Align emotions and cognitions]], [[Integrate your values]], [[§Vision]]). However, we might be too aroused to do that effectively, so we need [[Effective self-soothing]] first.

This implies that minimising displacement activity is the way to a more meaningful, fuller life. ([[How can we minimise displacement activities]]). This seems likely. To play devil's advocate:

It might also best be solved by unconscious processes marinating on the problem, and that requires displacement activities that aren't too engaging - e.g. a long walk.

However, [[Modern life has made displacement activities too attractive]].

	* This is different from a plan; a plan is more rigid, a series of steps. A vision is an outline, and somewhere you want to go. It is easier to change, but still offers direction, helping you to let go of [[Displacement activity]] in favour of something more meaningful.
