# Better systems miss the point, what we want is better action
This is a sub-component of [[Do the work]].

We only want to improve on systems when we are pretty certain that we'll spend enough time with them to reap the gains of small improvement * time.

This is sometimes dangerous for me, as I can prefer system improvement to doing the actual work.
