# §My Relationship with Pernille
Where do I want to move this towards? We spend more time together as intellectual beings, pondering how the world works and how we can shape it more to our [[§Vision]].

When we encounter challenges, we try to solve them by comparing them to other challenges, formulating theories, rules and systems for how the world works.

We’re comfortable and skilled around each other’s bodies.

*Is there potential?* 
* [[§My Vision for a Partnership]]
Very much so! Pernille is highly intelligent, and she enjoys nerding out. The question is whether she enjoys it to the same extent as I do, but the only way to find out is to try! This is also how we keep the relationship from turning too mundane.

* [[§My Vision for a Family]] 
Pernille is much better than I am at hygge, which is quintessential for a well-functioning family. I think she’ll make a decent wife, and a pretty good mother.
