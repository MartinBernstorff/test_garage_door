# I am averse to work when at home
#### Define the problem
Psychologically it’s hard. I’m averse to getting started with work, and I tend to end work earlier. 

I think the mechanism is largely having to suppress habits, which are in large part triggered by context and cues. Especially habits around Conqueror’s Blade are a challenge.

I also don’t get the boost from having the “work” habit in my work context. 

But it’s definitely amplified by the recent change in context, ie. that I haven’t been working from home for a while. As such, giving this idea some time to stew is not bad.

#### Shape a strategy
Either work away from home, or keep going.
