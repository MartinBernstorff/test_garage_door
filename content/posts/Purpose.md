# Purpose
For [[Enjoyable usefulness]] to happen, we need to find out both how we can enjoy ourselves and how we can be useful. This means exploring desires and passions, while also finding things that need doing, that allow us to be useful. These can serve as purposed.

That is what [[§Nobility]] is about, and is an alternative to [[Mission]].
