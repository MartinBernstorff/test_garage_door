# Add RSS support to md extractor
I'd like for my options to appear to me when I don't know what to do. That is not unlikely to be when I have my iPad or my iPhone with me, or when I check RSS.

This is an extension of [[Extract tags with context from notes to Airtable]].

As a strategy:
+ Setup RSS in kill-the-newsletter
+ Setup a list of lists with name these in send_email.py
