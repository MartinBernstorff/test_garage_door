# Use values to select goals

> If you don’t decide where you’re going, you’ll end up wherever you’re heading.

This is easier if you [[Keep your values salient]]. Avoid the false dichotomy of [[How do we balance goals and values]]. 

Check up on [[§What I value]], and then select the area which is most important to work on right now.

After that, you want to set meaningful goals. This means  that you:
1. Shortly summarise your values
2. Set an immediate goal (something you can do today).
3. Set some short-term goals (the next week)
4. Set some medium-range goals (the next month)
5. Set some long-term goals (the next year/few years)

Don't set a dead person's goals, ie. don't set goals that is about not doing something or stopping doing something. To convert it, ask yourself "if I was not doing X, what would I be doing with my time".

For these goals, adhere to something like [[SMART goals]]. This increases the probability of you getting them done.

Then [[WOOP]] the goal. If you find that you still have trouble starting, make use of [[Preparing for discomfort increases willingness]]
