# A weekend in my ideal partnership â€“ vision from 26/07/2021
```
These are much more flexible! This is where we find room for visiting family, meeting up with friends, longer activities etc.
```

We wake up together in near-total darkness after a long night's sleep. No alarm clock unless it's necessary.

We kiss each other good morning, and press the button that starts the morning routine. We embrace each other as we hear the coffee machine start brewing, we feel the warmth of the sun as the blinds separate, and the lights start to fade in. 

I go for a 5-10 minute shower, and she joins me when she wants to; but we always know that the shower is to be short, and we're just there to relax for a bit.

We then sit down to meditate, to get calm and clarity; for 5 minutes or 30 minutes, whatever we need, and we're free to get up separately or together.

We then set down to eat breakfast, which is typically a quiet affair. We plan the first part of our day (which is typically individual on projects), and then sync up about any difficulties we might see coming up or points where we might be able to help each other. 

Then we each come up with propositions for how to spend the afternoon, incorporating both activities we'd like to do individually and activities we'd like to do together. This can be working on projects individually, working on projects together, couple's activities etc.

A part of the suggestion is "free block for X hours", where when the block starts, we sit down and plan out what we'd like to do. 

Then we set out to do our individual activities, meet up for a late lunch, and then do what we wanted to do together.
