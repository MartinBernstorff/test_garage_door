# Try out Gingkoapp for planning multiple time horizons
I’ve tried it, and relatively quickly it felt coercive, like an obligation. This is something I want to avoid like the plague, so I did! 

I have tons of things that are interesting to me, and I’d much rather protect this interest (and gain velocity from it!) than force myself into strategic thinking.

## Backlinks
* [[?Plan spanning multiple time horizons]]
	* [[Try out Gingkoapp for planning multiple time horizons]] - didn’t go terribly well. Instead I might try having the same time horizons, but in Bear app? I can try it with adding links to each daily note to the corresponding time horizons – or do it with intervals? The important thing is that [[Human-friendly systems allow for forgetting]].
