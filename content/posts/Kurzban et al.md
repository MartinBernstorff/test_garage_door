Some neural networks are useful for solving a variety of problems, some of which are simultaneously available. This results in the need for prioritization. Fatigue is experienced as a result of sub-networks evaluating the current prioritization as sub-optimal, ie:

1. A neural mechanism that evaluates the difference between the expected utility of the current task and the expected utility of alternative tasks (ie. the opportunity cost), resulting in
2. The qualia of boredom/task-fatigue, resulting in
3. Decreased task performance or task switching

Add in a time-dependent exploitation penalty (the longer you stick to the same task, the higher the perceived penalty) to ensure higher fitness in changing environments, and you have a decent model.

In the same vein, the homeostatic sleep mechanism can be thought of as an opportunity cost on a larger scale, balancing out of exploration the current environment with exploitation of the day's information.

Be aware of the term task-fatigue, it is distinctly different from sleepiness.

* [[Friction facilitates focus]]
	* A large amount of salient options incur overhead because of their implied opportunity cost ([[Kurzban et al.]]).
* [[Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman]]
	* This is somewhat different from [[Kurzban et al.]], which argues that we switch tasks to avoid opportunity costs, as part of an explore/exploit problem. Iâ€™m more sympathetic to the second view.
* [[The Lagrangian: Time Depletion]]
	* This ties in with [[Kurzban et al.]]. Mental effort arises when a single task occupies a multi-function area of the brain, incurring opportunity costs.
