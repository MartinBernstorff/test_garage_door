# Journal club 27/10 – Cluster analysis
“Data were collected through
recruiting general practitioners surgeries (43 accepted; 50%
acceptance) and sending out questionnaires to all patients
aged 16–85 (achieving a response rate of 15.9%). Data were self-reported.”

* How does response rates affect our interpretation of cluster credibility?
	* Depends on the pattern of non-response
		* Do we think important clusters are missing
		* Or do we think that the actual clusters didn’t respond, leaving us with whatever’s in the middle?
	* Poor response rates are going to lead to less belief in external validity
	* Out-of-sample validation
 
 
” The (cluster) analysis is exploratory and hypothesis generating. Although it  cannot identify causation, the results are often used to drive future research”

* When are the clusters identified credible enough to trust for generating a hypothesis?
	* If they match clinical experience, and/or
	* If the contrast in the variables between clusters is meaningful and/or
 
“There is no well-defined method for determining the optimal number of clusters. The number of clusters needs to be large enough to capture the important features in the data, but not too large that interpretation becomes difficult.”

* What should determine the number of clusters chosen when doing exploratory research? Epidemiological pre-knowledge, statistical significance, clinical relevance or something else?
	* Epidemiological pre-knowledge and clinical relevance, as well as statistical methods
	* Also whether the clusters have predictive validity, eg. are associated to outcomes
	* Out-of-sample validation
 
These are merely suggestions. If you have other topics to discuss on the article or cluster analysis in general, please bring them up J
