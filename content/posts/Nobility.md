# Nobility
Nobility in the sense of connecting with others, of seeing them as who they are and using that knowledge for the greater good. 

It is a way of being, of manifesting glory for the benefit of others, of doing as much as we can to manifest [[Enjoyable usefulness]]. 

It's also about overcoming laziness ([[What separates lack of passion\/enjoyment from laziness?]]). That means that it is not easy.

A celibrity showing off their charity work is not noble; they serve to rise, whereas nobility rises to serve.

This is an intention, which means that it's available to everyone.
