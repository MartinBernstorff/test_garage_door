# Vision for Work: Private Sector, Data-science
Denmark has, by far, the best set of data for developing ML for healthcare. Accelerating this process can establish better feedback-loops for the entire world, and chart what is currently possible.

Making my PhD as effective as possible at charting this territory is the most high-impact thing I can do right now. To do that, I need to become a better software developer fast, so we can establish a pipeline for trying out ML algorithms. 

When that is established, it’s probably about science communication, and talking to clinicians about options and implementation.
