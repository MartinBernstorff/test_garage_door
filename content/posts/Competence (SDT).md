# Competence (SDT)
---
Q. Which tasks fulfill the need for competence?
A. Tasks which we have chosen, find important and do well

## Backlinks
* [[§Deep Novelty]]
	* Q. How might [[§Deep Novelty]] lead to superior well-being compared to [[§Shallow novelty]]?
* [[Building requires repeated attention]]
	* If we're to get good at [[Building]] (eg. to satisfy [[Competence (SDT)]]), we need to keep practicing it. Especially since being at the forefront of anything typically requires some degree of prior knowledge, implying that we need to [[Balance exploration and specialisation]].
* [[§Stronger Together (platonic)]]
	* We also get to be there for others, so exercise our faculties ([[Competence (SDT)]]) while making the world better.
* [[MIL avoids burnout]]
	* Competence/mastery ([[Competence (SDT)]])
* [[Savour life alone]]
	* And so it goes for [[§Teamfight Tactics]]. All it provides is [[§Shallow novelty]] and a false sense of [[Competence (SDT)]]. While you do get better, you're getting better at something that provides no value to others. Since [[Happiness is best pursued by improving the lives of others]], this is a crowding out of a meaningful, happy life.
* [[§Recreation]]
	* Mastery ([[Competence (SDT)]])
* [[MIL contains interesting problems]]
	* It's probably through a very strong satisfaction of [[Competence (SDT)]].
* [[Curiosity is only bounded by competing motivations]]
	* E.g. if we spend all our time on [[§Shallow novelty]], we don't get increases in [[Competence (SDT)]], so we don't satisfy our basic psychological needs. Or, if we're highly challenged, there's not enough cognitive resources left for exploration and novelty. 
* [[Humans thrive while satisfying desires]]
	* Q. Which ingredients maximise human thriving?
* [[Solitude]]
	* [[Competence (SDT)]]
* [[Which needs might gaming be dysfunctionally trying to meet]]
	* E.g. [[Competence (SDT)]].
