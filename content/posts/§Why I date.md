# §Why I date
* [[I date because it is is fun]]
* [[I date to find a long-term partner]]

*Principles*

However, there are some rules that I won't violate:

1. I won't lie or dance around the truth to make a woman infatuated with me.
2. I won't convince a woman to be with me, if I don't believe it's in her and our best interest.

In my ideal world, dating consists of three distinct phases:

1. *Exploration*: I date a lot of women, and my barrier for entry is low. I focus a lot on getting to know my preferences better, while also sharpening my flirtation and getting comfortable around women. I probably have a couple of one night stands, simply to know what they're about, and if they're something for me. I do this for around 4/10ths of the time alotted to dating.
2. *[[Romantic Auditioning]]*: See description in folder.
3. *Fusion*: A monogamous relationship where we're both dedicated to each other and to a higher purpose. 


However, these stages are not rigid. If I find someone during the exploration phase who's, say, +2SD above average, I move on to auditioning with her. Anything less makes no sense.

For more on the above, see the NPM descriptions in each folder.
