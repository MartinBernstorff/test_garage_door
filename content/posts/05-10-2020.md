The [[Taskheat vs TimeHero]] problem is going to make a huge difference I think.

Thinking about Charlottes ideas [[Can I split articles into 6-week projects?]], and whether I think we have better ideas available is going to be high yield as well.

I want to check email so bad, but I know it isn’t worth the distraction right now.

I can also expand on [[§Problem solving]], which ties into [[How do I balance think-research-read-do-experience]].

I think today went pretty well! It was a short day with some confusion, but it ended well.
