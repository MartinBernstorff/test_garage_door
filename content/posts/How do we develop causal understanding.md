# How do we develop causal understanding
Causal understanding arises when we have multiple causal hypotheses that we can contrast based on the information at hand. Essentially, it requires experiments, or information that we believe we can interpret without experimentation – some causal models can be rejected from observational information alone (see [[§Causal inference]]).

Much of it arises through [[§Intuition]], but for some areas, intuition is dramatically insufficient.
