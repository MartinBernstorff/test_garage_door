# Select games to avoid problematic use
[[Games are not created equal]], so this means selecting the games with the most [[§Gaming upsides]] and the fewest [[§Gaming downsides]]. 

It probably makes sense to evaluate games individually on those parameters when choosing which games to play.

For me at least, some of the worst are [[§First Person Shooters]] and games with a clear path to obtainable goals (eg. [[§Conqueror's Blade]]). I want games that are fun to play together, but that I’d not want to play alone. Like board-games.
