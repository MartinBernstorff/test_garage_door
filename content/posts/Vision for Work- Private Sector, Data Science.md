# Vision for Work: Private Sector, Data Science
Showing up to work, most of it consists of deliberation, meetings, planning. Iâ€™d love for it to contain at least some programming as well, e.g. for exploring the feasibility of a given project. 

I love working with nerds; people who like modelling the world, who think about how things work and are skilled at what they do. 

To which extent this is possible is, so far, unknown. This indicates more exploration, specifically contacting Lasses contact. B an Z plans are medicine.

Strategy:
* Figure out which areas I'd enjoy working in
	* Competences
		* Data-science
		* [[Real World Evidence (RWE)]]
		* Clinical trials
	* Areas
		* Pharma
		* Implementation (e.g. systematic, columna)
