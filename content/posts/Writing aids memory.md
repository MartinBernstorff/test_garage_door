# Writing aids memory
This depends in large part on what kind of writing you do. If you’re merely summarising, the benefit is going to be small ([[Summarisation is low utility]]), but if you’re elaborating on and connection the idea to things you know, the benefit increases ([[Elaborative encoding is high utility]]).
