# Ask to explain
This is basically the socratic method. If someone is to truly understand something, they have to walk the path to understanding themselves.

You can guide them with questions, but you can't just explain it to them. That leads to low retention, basically missing out on [[§Elaborative encoding]]. 

However, if the person is to feel understood, it's incredibly important to be open to whatever they bring up.
