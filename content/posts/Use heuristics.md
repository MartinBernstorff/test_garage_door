# Use heuristics
[[Precision and speed are a trade-off]], especially with prioritisation. 

Heuristics are rules of thumb, general principles that serve us well in most cases and make decision making tremendously easier. 

They are essential when prioritising ([[Use heuristics for prioritisation]]).

Heuristics can be developed both unconsciously ([[Intuition is emergent heuristics]]) and consciously ([[Deliberate about models]], [[All models are heuristics]]).

When do heuristics especially fool us? I think especially when [[Intuition is emergent heuristics]], and we fail to evaluate whether there's reason to believe that we have accurate intuition in this area (whether feedback is available, whether feedback is valid and amount of practice). 

Unfortunately, high subjective confidence is not a good indication of validity ([[Einhorn 1978]], [[Arkes 2001]]).

But also systematic errors like the [[Anchoring effect]].

[[Consistency determines confidence in intuition]]

Q. Why might we use heuristics?
A. Because [[Precision and speed are a trade-off]], and [[Heuristics are low effort]]
