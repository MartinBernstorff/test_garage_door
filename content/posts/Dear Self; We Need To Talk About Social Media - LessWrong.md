[[Making the Most of Social Media]]

Knowing that notifications can come at any time will change your mental state. As will knowing that a notification might be waiting for you at any time (!!). This is buffered potential novelty with variable rate reward, like always having a slot machine at the ready.

It will limit the states that your mind allow itself to get into, literally limiting your experience.

We’re wired to respond strongly to this! In the wild, situations like these meant that we might miss out - someone else might act upon it! But as the world grows more connected, these situations are everywhere – and situations where we won’t even miss out imitate them to such an extent that we exhibit the same behaviour. All the squeeze without the juice. E.g. waiting for an email that isn’t really going to change our behavior.
