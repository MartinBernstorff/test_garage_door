# Minimise inventory
The idea is to avoid [[Carrying costs]]. For knowledge work, this applies primarily to work in process ([[Balance WIP]]), as we have little or no carrying costs from work that isn't started or work that is finished.

One problem is that if you've misunderstood something, then you'll have to correct it in all papers that are in process. 

Possible countermeasures are [[Just in time (JIT)]].
