# Write for steps or writing for leaps?
When Andy Matuschak thinks, it seems he uses his notes as waypoints, rather than to do the groundwork of thinking.

More detailed writing is likely to amplify [[Writing prompts new connections]] and [[Writing prompts sharper understanding]]. But it also slows us down; while typing, my conscious thinking slows down. 

But that doesn’t mean that subconscious thinking slows down. 

It may also prompt metacognitive strategies, which themselves can improve problem-solving.

For now, I need sharp thinking and new connections more than I need speed. I’ll keep typing at a rather high level of detail.
