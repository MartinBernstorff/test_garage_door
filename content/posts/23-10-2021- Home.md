## Morning
*How am I feeling?*
A little fatigued right now, probably due to information overflow from BT and EB. 

I turned that into revamping my Mailbrew to allow for meandering/exploration, that is now generated on Sundays. Will have to see if that matches where I want to be over time.

One realisation is that energy management is, to some extent, like supply chain management, and thus subject to the [[Theory of Constraints]]. This is meant in the sense that we only have X extremely focused hours in us in a day, and the rest are more fungible. In that sense, focused hours can be thought of as one “machine” in a sequence of machines required to get work done. 

It is likely also the primary bottleneck for most people. As such, it should be optimised according to the [[Theory of Constraints]]. [[Theory of Constraints]]
