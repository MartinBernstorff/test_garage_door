[[Action menus can facilitate choice]]
[[Measure time well spent]]

[[Minimum Lovable Product]] is probably [[Measure time well spent]] in isolation. This does take the focus somewhat away from my goals, though, and focuses it on the actions. 

However, it already allows me to create my own browseable menu from which I can pick what I want to do for a given activity.
