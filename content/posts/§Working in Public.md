# §Working in Public
[[Is learning in public beneficial to the work I do]]

It means that I will get feedback, and [[Building requires feedback]] ([[§Feedback]]).

However, feedback can also make things less fun. I'm not sure I want to create, as much as I want to just learn and think. I'm not sure I want an audience per se.

On the other hand, getting positive feedback can be immensely useful in motivating you.

Working in public also encourages you to explain things, which highlights your degree of understanding. After all, [[We tend to overrate our 'how-it-works' understanding]].
