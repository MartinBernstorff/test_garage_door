# Academia promotes short term optimization
Is there a hypothetical world where I would be an academic working on the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture right now? Sure. It's probably a world where high-flying students are given, upon graduation, some sort of "mini-Genius Grant". If I had been awarded a five-year $62,500/year grant with the sole condition of "do research", I would almost certainly have persevered in academia and — despite working on the more interesting but longer-term questions — have had enough publications after those five years to obtain a continuing academic position. But that's not how granting agencies work; they give out one or two year awards, with the understanding that those who are successful will apply for more funding later.

In short, academic institutions systemically promote exactly the sort of short-term optimization of which, ironically, the private sector is often accused. Is entrepreneurship a trap? No; right now, it's one of the only ways to avoid being trapped.
