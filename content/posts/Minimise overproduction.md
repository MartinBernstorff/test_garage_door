# Minimise overproduction
Producing more than can be consumed is problematic. 

It can
* Overload a constraint ([[Subordinate non-bottlenecks]])
* Increase [[Carrying costs]]

One example of this is [[Avoid overinforming]].

To avoid this, use [[Just in time (JIT)]], implement a "tact time" (eg. agile cycles), or introduce a pull system (eg. Kanban).

* [[Validate research ideas]]
	* Ie. is there a higher level of abstraction we can work on, while not inducing too much overhead for co-authors? Given the sparcity of time I can get with all co-authors, they're most likely going to be bottlenecks. To [[Subordinate non-bottlenecks]], it makes sense for me to do more processing before showing it to them. This does collid with [[Minimise waste]], specifically [[Minimise overproduction]] and [[Minimise overprocessing]].
