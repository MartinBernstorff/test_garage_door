# Relevance Realisation
The process by which we determine what is relevant. 

Relevance is defined as the factors which matter for a given problem, and is typically a combination of:
* Causality
* Modifiability/affordances
	* Amplitude

Typically arises when we solve the [[Frame Problem]] by framing a problem in a way that makes the solution near-obvious, what we call [[Insight problem solving]].

	* And how do we do [[Relevance Realisation]]?
* [[Ep. 28 - Convergence To Relevance Realization - Awakening from the Meaning Crisis]]
	* [[Relevance Realisation]] is the consequence of getting good at [[Define the problem]], which Vervaeke calls “Insight”.
	* Since there are infinite potential consequences of every action ([[Butterfly Effect]]), to avoid [[Combinatorial Explosion]], [[Relevance Realisation]] requires us to ignore information *without checking it*. Otherwise, all your time will be spent on the checking, you’ll essentially be [[Thrashing (scheduling)]].
	* In this framing, teaching citizens, or journalists, or politicians basic scientific methodology is a way of bootstrapping our society’s capacity for [[Relevance Realisation]]. [[Teaching Epistemology]]
	* One of the problems with school is that it deprives us of real-life experience, which then again makes it much harder for us to prioritise, to arrive at [[Relevance Realisation]]. It assumes that we can [[§Forecasting]] what is required, 10, 20 years down the line, but this seems increasingly unlikely.
* [[Mike Anki make it harder for us to do relevance realisation]]
	* And, by extension, make us less intelligent? Maybe, as a counter, we might ask [[What determines how often we want to see a prompt]], and then reframe the buttons to be 'more or less frequent', allowing our [[Relevance Realisation]] to guide prompt frequency.
