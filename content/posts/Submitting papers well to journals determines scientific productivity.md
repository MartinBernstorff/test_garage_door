# Submitting papers well to journals determines scientific productivity
Should be obvious, but I get the sense that many papers end up in a drawer where they don't end up being productive.

This requires:
1. Determination
2. Writing good cover letters
3. [[Choosing the right journals determines scientific productivity]]

Since these determine how long the paper is going to be unpublished, there is no ceiling to these factors combined.
