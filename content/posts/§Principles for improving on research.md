# §Principles for improving on research
General principles can be gleaned from [[§General principles for optional activities]].

Right now, I have many research points in my notes, without being reminded of them nor making much progress on them. Essentially, they're an inbox, but [[Inboxes feel like obligations]].

I want it to be something I stumble upon, open questions that I can ponder and/or work on by reading the relevant material.

[[Research questions should be presented with context]], to gain a deeper understanding. Since we need to [[Define the problem]] as well as possible, we need context to know whether the material we're reading is actually helping us answer the question that needs answering.

[[Building requires repeated attention]], so I want to encourage following a rabbit-hole. This allows me to [[Balance exploration and specialisation]].
