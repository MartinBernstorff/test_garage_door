# Set up the right feedback loops
To do this, we first need to [[Define the problem]]. 

When we have found out where improvement is the highest leverage (ie. regularising wins and making failures less likely), then we can set up the right feedback loops.

For me, I tend to:
* I tend to over-optimise, especially for workflows that I won’t use for very long
* 

## Backlinks
* [[Filter feedback]]
	* This means it’s incredibly important to [[Set up the right feedback loops]]. It's one of the components of [[Go for efficient feedback]].
* [[§Feedback]]
	* [[Set up the right feedback loops]]
