# We need values in addition to goals
[[Living by values increases vitality]] and [[Living by values provides meaning]]. They're necessary to keep going, since [[A meaningful life contains discomfort]].

Values are available to us always. If you love playing baseball to be cooperative and competitive, even if you're paralyzed from the waist down, you can still play paralympic basketball.

We can act on them in any moment, eg. we can be cooperative almost no matter which action we take.

We are never finished with values, so they keep giving us directions for our entire life-course.

And we can guarantee that we can live by our values, whereas we can't guarantee that we'll get the marriage we want.

	* It has to be something that you can do, but not complete, making values different from goals – goals have a distinct end-point, values are a direction. [[We need values in addition to goals]].
