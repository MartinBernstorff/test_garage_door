# Efficiency only relieves overwhelm if the goalposts are static
There’s something about chasing efficiency because you’re overwhelmed. You hope that becoming more efficient will grant you the time that you want, but that depends on whether:

* Someone wants to maximise your output, leading to a shifting of goal-posts or
* Completing tasks lead to more tasks, i.e. the [[§Efficiency Paradox]]

If neither of these conditions are met, efficiency might very well lead you to more leisure! If some of them are, chasing efficiency maintains an illusion that you can ever be “on top of things”, as well as adding another “meta-task” to your list!
