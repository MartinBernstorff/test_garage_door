# §Refactoring
Refactoring is the principle of rewriting code to make it easier to read and maintain. 

You can get good at refactoring at three levels: 
* The principal level, where there are patterns to learn
* For each language language, where some patterns are e.g. "pythonic"
* At the IDE, where some tools make your life much, much easier. [[Refactoring in VSCode]]

Work through these as examples, convert them to Python:
