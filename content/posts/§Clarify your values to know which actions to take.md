# §Clarify your values to know which actions to take
[[Living by values increases vitality]] and [[Living by values provides meaning]]. They're necessary to keep going, since [[A meaningful life contains discomfort]].

By values, we mean something:

1. {We can continually do}
2. {With global qualities (eg. being supportive rather than being a good gift-giver)}
3. {That we desire}

It has to be something that you can do, but not complete, making values different from goals – goals have a distinct end-point, values are a direction. [[We need values in addition to goals]].

To clarify your values, try some exercises. However, it's important not to get side-tracked by what is realistic or what you "deserve". We're daring to dream, then we'll deal with obstacles later.

This works best if it's experiential, rather than intellectual – this makes it a good idea to do a bit of mindfulness first, then visualise it.
