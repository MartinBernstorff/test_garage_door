# Is BDS a proper diagnosis
Bodily distress syndrome (BDS) attempts to unify multiple functional somatic syndromes.

It does so since:
[[Functional somatic syndromes have high co-occurence]]
[[Functional somatic syndromes share pathophysiology]]

[[Functional somatic syndromes share patient response]] â€“ but does this indicate that they are separate from somatic syndromes, or only that interventions that improve well-being work on almost anything?
