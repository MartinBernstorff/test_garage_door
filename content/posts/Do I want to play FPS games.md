# Do I want to play FPS games
It also depends on whether FPS games are actually fun for me, or just intense â€“ and to which extent I can get the same stimulation via hardball instead.

## Backlinks
* [[Do I want as intense hedonism as possible]]
	* Since [[MIL is fun]] and I have decent mechanisms for adjusting overrun ([[Complice.co]], [[Beeminder]]), does this imply to make those as enjoyable as possible as well? Eg. [[Do I want to play FPS games]]? 
	* On the other hand, it dramatically ups the addictiveness potential, but that can be (at least somewhat) balanced via Beeminder ([[Do I want to play FPS games]]).
