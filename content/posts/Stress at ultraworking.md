# Stress at ultraworking
New interpretation:  The stress arose due to perceived lack of control, because I was externalizing executive function (Choice, planning, order) to an auto-scheduler. 

This meant that I felt like there was an endless amount of work that I was obligated to do, that this work was no longer current and grew stale. Since I was working on clock time, I felt like I was always behind and wasnâ€™t the locus of control for my actions.

The mistake, then, was not work hard - it was overriding my dislike of a lack of control while turning an endless stream of tasks into an obligation.
