# When am I working hard enough?
This “enough” term points me toward some external criterium, but there probably isn’t one. Rather, there are options that you can select if you think that’s meaningful – if it’s worth exerting effort for.

That means that there will be cases where I don’t desire working, and where I'll work anyway ([[§Determination]], [[§Effort]], [[§Resistance]]).

It also means that there won’t be a hard answer to:
* [[How many hours should I work?]] or 
* [[How much effort should I expend on work?]]. 

It all depends on what is most meaningful, and that changes depending on time and context. That may seem disorienting, and it is – but it is also a source of freedom.

We can’t rely only on our emotions, though ([[Avoid laziness]]).

Q. When might you be working hard enough?
A. When you’re meaningfully useful

In this question, what do I mean by meaningfully? I mean it in the sense of [[Meaningness]]. 

That isn’t a hard criterium, unfortunately. But certainty is probably not realistic to attain here – there isn’t an ordering principle to guide us ([[Eternalism]]).
