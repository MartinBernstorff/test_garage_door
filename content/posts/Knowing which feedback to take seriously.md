# Knowing which feedback to take seriously
Knowing which feedback to take seriously

This is one of the strongest multipliers - eg. wrongly interpreting succes states will make any algorithm fail.

Since we often don't have a control condition in real life, we can easily over-attrinite feedback.

Goes for social skills as well - someone getting mad may, or may not, be useful feedback on whether your action was desirable. Interpreting this correctly is an essential skill.

How do we get better at this? It depends on whether the feedback is valid, which can borrow information from whether a diagnosis is valid.

Unreliable feedback may be due to there not being a system to learn, or due to high system complexity - eg. unexpected gifts elicit much higher happiness than expected gifts.

This is a strong modifier on whether deliberate practice is useful. If feedback is ambiguous, or wrongly interpreted, it won't result in improvement.
