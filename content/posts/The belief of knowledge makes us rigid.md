# The belief of knowledge makes us rigid
If we believe something to be true, it automatically limits what we consider. There are fundamentals that we don’t question. This can be terrible, in that it can entrench local optima. But is also necessary, because there isn’t time to question everything. 

Because this is a question we encounter all the time, we need heuristics to make the decision of whether to question something easier to make.

* If there are no agreed upon fundamentals, eg. knowledge work, where most of the meta work is ad hoc and idiosyncratic.
* In areas with strong tradition, where breaking a limit would yield huge differences. 
* When we believe that traditions are likely not valid, eg. in areas with low validity in the environment, or insufficient time to develop expertise.

Q. When might questioning conventional wisdom be especially important?
A. In environments with low validity or insufficient practice.
