# NSSH: Review #1
## Chunky comments
### Reviewer 1
#### General
	* Appears they think we're doing causal estimation - or that they are unclear about the delineation of causal estimates and predictions.

#### Specific quotes
* There are several other studies that linked some of the individual symptoms with the outcomes of interest, and the rationale of the proposed study should contextualise the present research within that evidence.
	* Previous research has examined symptoms individually. However, since the symptoms are highly correlated [11], it is unknown to which extent adding more symptoms to the scale improves its predictive power.

* Also, it's unclear the extent to which the selected symptoms are simply markers of the severity of underlying disorders as opposed to independent predictors of unexplained symptoms. 
	* This is a great point, and a question we'd love to answer. It appears unlikely that symptoms occur without an underlying process, however, the relevance of MHC as a measure is independent of whether this is the case. 
	* If MHC is a predictor of hospital contacts, then it can be used as an indicator of future healthcare utilisation in the individual or in a group - regardless of why MHC occur.

* Not clear why only the latest report data was kept for the online questionnaire responders - why not take advantage of the repeated measurements, even if only for a small subsample of the original cohort.
	* Ah, we just add that the HBSC-SCL was measured only once.

* In this Reviewer opinion confounding by indication would apply to the study design and might be worth considering ways to adjust for it in analyses. 
	* A causal thing to do, how do we phrase this?

### Reviewer 2
#### General
Appears they also would like us ot examine underlying mechanisms - but we cannot do that. Or, we would have to do a speculative DAG, basically re-doing most of our analyses. I'm uncertain about how to reply to the questions below, but a very rough draft is:
*What is the contribution of the study?* 
MHC is a WHO measure which is arbitrarily defined, and has never been studied. This measure is only helpful in informing public health policy if it is predictive of relevant outcomes, e.g. hospital use. This is what the present study tests.

#### Specific quotes
* Purpose: Why is this study necessary? Please include the motivation of the study in Purpose.

* For the paragraph starting from “Among patients with non-specific”, please clarify the authors’ perspective on the health complaints (see the comment #3 for introduction) and discuss. 
* It’s still unclear why longitudinal follow-up was necessary if the purpose was the extent to which ‘health complaints’ reflects true health conditions – in that case, cross-sectional study was suffice. 
* The authors mentioned about possibility that the association between health complaints and number of hospital contact was “causal”. 
* Why could it be causal? Explaining this (and reflecting this to earlier text, such as Introduction and first paragraph of Discussion) will finally help to clarify the motivation of this study and underlying mechanisms.
