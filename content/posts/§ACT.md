# §ACT
Also known as [[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]]

Pronounced Act. 

The primary tenet of ACT is to notice when you're having unhelpful thoughts and feelings, make space for them, and then focus on doing what matters to you.

* [[Align emotions and cognitions]]
	* An [[§ACT]] view would be to notice emotions and, if they’re not aligned with who you want to be, make space for them and then take the action you believe to be right anyway. [[Choosing is everything]], and making these choices is what makes us human.
	* while using the [[§ACT]] method whenever our emotions are poorly aligned.
* [[$The Happiness Trap]]
	* A book on [[§ACT]].
* [[§Values]]
	* [[§ACT]].
* [[How do I use goals without being constricted by them? (Motivationally and good hating)]]
	* Inspired by [[§ACT]], I'm considering using goals to increase my performance on the things that matter most to me.
* [[Prefer work in the right mental state]]
	* On the other hand, in the spirit of [[§ACT]], your feelings are often not great indicators of what the right thing to do is. And Mieke tends to do her work at whichever time of day is required. [Routines of creatives](https://podio.com/site/creative-routines) vary widely, albeit most of them did have most of their creative work before admin/leisure.
* [[Caring emotionally might be necessary]]
	* On a surface level, this has tension with [[§ACT]]. ACT argues that that [[Emotions are volatile]], at least in the moment, so they aren’t terribly helpful. However, taking action, and especially [[§Effort]] is much easier to apply if you feel like it’s the right thing to do. 
	* Furthermore, volatility ≠ low validity. Noise doesn't mean there isn't signal. I think [[§ACT]] would agree that, when emotions are consistent, and we can't cognitively disprove what they're saying (ie. we don't expect bias), then they're worth listening to. [[Emotions are messengers]].
* [[We don't know our shared values]]
	* Whether this is a problem depends to a large extent on how much we want to live by the [[§ACT]] principles.
