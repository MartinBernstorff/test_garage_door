* [[§Scheduling for a single agent]]
	* However, this is costly due to [[§Context Switching]] ([[Balance context switching]]). When, then, should we switch? I think when the increase in impact (time · density) is larger than the cost of the context-switch. Can we make that into a heuristic?
	* An example of [[Interrupt Coalescing (use Batching)]], to decrease [[§Context Switching]].
	* Downsides is that it increases average waiting time, and total throughput is lower due to [[§Context Switching]].
