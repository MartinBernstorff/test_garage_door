# How does SkedPal vs. TimeHero affect my emotional response to completing tasks
SkedPal reschedules my tasks, but doesn't allow me to set an "x hours" goal like TimeHero does.

This means that I'm not working towards a set goal in SkedPal, rather, I'm working until I hit some calendar time end.

For TimeHero, I'm motivated since [[Informational process goals are motivating]]. When I assign an expected amount of time to a task, that's essentially how complicated I expect the task to be. Completing X expected hours of tasks means, then, that I've moved the project X amount of the way forward.

While SkedPal allows me to be more specific about the order of tasks, that's both a blessing and a curse. It means I need to spend more time managing them, and less time actually getting work done. It also dramatically increases the complexity for the engine, leading to slower re-schedules. Especially for intra-day tasks, [[$Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]], except for highly creative tasks â€“ but I can still promote those by adding an importance flag in TimeHero.

When I stop taking as much time considering in which order to do things, it appears that TimeHero may be a good trade-off since it allows for both:
* [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]]
* [[Decrease options to make decision-making easier]]
