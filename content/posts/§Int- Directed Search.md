# §Int. Directed Search
Directed search is when I have a question and look for sources to answer it.

I probably want to do directed search rarely; when it is the fulcrum of an argument or a decision.

Typically, it makes me fatigued from a ton of context switching, and the decision it informs is:
a) Rarely very important and
b) Only weakly influenced by the search

After all, [[§Deep Novelty]] is rare and not attention-grabbing, so it is even rarer when doing directed search.
