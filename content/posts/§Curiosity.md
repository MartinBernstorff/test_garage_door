# §Curiosity
[[§Curiosity]] solves problems in two ways, [[§Novelty search]] and helping realise a [[§Vision]]. This makes it incredibly important, while also being tremendously fun and meaningful. Therefor, it makes sense to [[Make the most of curiosity]], and one of the best ways of doing that is to [[Let curiosity guide you]].

I think [[Curiosity]] can be used as a synonym for [[§Intrinsic motivation]], but I'm not quite sure yet.

Curiosity probably can't be promoted, it can be protected and nurtured. It's an innate, intrinsic property; we desire to experience and explore the world and how it works.

[[How might we nurture curiosity?]]

A great example of it, as well as of [[§Playfulness]], is the Evan and Katelyn blog.
