# Consume collected information quickly
Consume quickly so you can add the information to your knowledge and help inform further steps. 

This limits overhead from collecting material on paths that you don't want to explore, or collecting material with large overlap ([[Curate inflow of information]], [[Quality check at low value]], [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]]).

I can facilitate that through low friction:
* Showing what I have already started reading
	* Widgets showing the most recently opened stuff
	* Widgets showing interesting selections
* Showing what I have selected as interesting
	* Pocket (or other read-it-later service, Adam Wiggins had one with spacing - might this be findable by searching for “Readwise” in Andy’s notes?)
	* Goodreads

Q. Why might we want to consume collected reading information without delay?
A. It helps inform our further research, decreasing overhead on [[§Int. Directed Search]].
