# Does the cognitive resource hypothesis hold water
Encountered in "Boost" by Grumann. Posits that to rest from work, we need to rest the relevant resources.

Implications for me would be that contemplation and research has to, at least when fatigued, be limited during leisure time. This has strong implications for Obsidian-use.
