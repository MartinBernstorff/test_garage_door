# Make ingest of flashcard-prompted ideas easy
[[What is my ideal flow for research]]

To make it easier to modify markdown notes from thoughts prompted by flashcards, link to 1Writers "new note" function. Also link to the specific note via the 1Writer URL scheme, and via the [Obsidian URL scheme](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v0-8-15/5697).

This makes sense to do in the emails (both research and media) as well.
