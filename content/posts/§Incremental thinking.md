# §Incremental thinking
I think I need some more structure in how I maintain and develop my notes. As it is right now, I don't separate evergreen notes from inbox notes, and I don't have a good routine for how to work on notes that are in my "inbox". 

This leads to some problems
* [[D: It's hard to start writing Evergreens]]

Secondly, separating inbox ideas from evergreen notes might make it easier for me to search through and find notes, and definitely easier to browse around and look at interesting things. Ideally, I'd want something like Andy's website for browsing my own notes, if that practice could be helpful.

This is an improvement to [[$My note system]].

	* OTOH, it might increase friction a bit too much, especially because it feels “destructive” to let something go. I imitate this via the [[§Incremental thinking]] and p0.
* [[Add a larger review function]]
	* To effectively [[Shepherd attention]], we need to leverage the moments of high reflectivity that we have, e.g. with [[§Incremental thinking]]. 
* [[You get what you measure]]
	* This is probably useful for dedicating time to work! And for dedicating time to [[§Incremental thinking]]. In essence, you want "do enough" goals for beeminder.
* [[Add a streak like function]]
	* To [[$My note system]] and [[§Incremental thinking]]. Something like if I edit a note I'd like to do more work on very soon, add #promoted hashtag. If a card has that hashtag, it has 100% chance of being selected. If it is passed over, the tag is removed.
* [[Add probabilistic automatic decay to incremental thinking]]

* [[D: It's hard to start writing Evergreens]]
	* Having a specific routine, like [[§Incremental thinking]], can make it much easier to get started. It runs the risk of [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], but since the postpone mechanism is lightweight, it may circumvent it. The best way to know is to try. 
	* Furthermore, if the work is integrated, the structure and scaffolding that [[§Incremental thinking]] can provide is  a strength. 
* [[Last step]]
	* Add a 'last step' prompt to [[§Incremental thinking]], to prompt adding flashcards if you demoted?
