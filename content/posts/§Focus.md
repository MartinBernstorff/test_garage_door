# §Focus
[[§Focus]] is the act of selecting something as a priority, and not getting distracted from it. 

It’s, by definition, what makes for a life well lived. Living by our priorities, our [[§Vision]], is living the life we want.

[[Focus is fundamental (coinage)]] and [[Choosing is everything]].
