# 26-Dec-21 - Homely
*How am I feeling?*
Might have COVID, so that’s not ideal. Other than that, would love to see some people, to have some around me. That’s what I need most and, ironically, what I can’t do. Getting an early test tomorrow is the best way of changing that.

Right now, I’m reaping the benefits of changing contexts. I need to take that *very* seriously, as it makes the difference between a day near-wasted gaming etc., vs. a day well spent working on multiple projects. 

This is probably the most important learning I have, [[Home is lack of intention]], and ideally, [[Home is relaxation]]. Even this last part, though, isn’t always completely true - the best forms of relaxation, e.g. [[§Exercise]], or reading, aren’t ideal at home either.

Really, what I want to avoid is using the computer at home, because it’s much more likely to devolve into behaviour which I do not want. 

- Think about next week, [[52-22 - Homely]]

- Write Pernille about seeing her, and COVID
