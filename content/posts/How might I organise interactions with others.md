# How might I organise interactions with others?
Eg. "activity with person".

I want "Game with Mads online" to be a separate activity from "Game alone online". That means that they need to be separate records in "activities". I also think the effect of undertaking the activity with someone else is so large that isolating the effect of the activity itself isn't meaningful.

If I want to facilitate doing more things with others, I can simply incorporate that into my ratings of "time well spent".
