# 02/11/2021 - Emotions
[[Sebastian Scott Engen]]

*Concepts*
Interoception

Embodiment

Predictive processing

Variability

Behaviorism -> Computationalism (difference is just an increase in complexity)

Perhaps the experience of an emotion is related to, but not strongly, the expression of the emotion. 

### Three Main Theories
*[[§Basic Emotions]]*
Hadza - 19% accuracy on "big 6" emotions, if removing happiness. 17% is chance.

*[[§Appraisal]]*

*[[§Psychological Construction]]* ([[How Emotions are Made]]).

Default Mode Network or interoceptive network or Salience Network - emotion processing? 

*Sebastian's ideas*
* Arousal might boost memory formation – but is that 0-sum?
	* And maybe boost emotion-concept learning

* Mood management
	* Body budget (does chronic sleep deprivation predict poor mood?)
	* Sensations from the outside world
	* Predictions from past experience (training of predictive engine)

## Questions
* How do we interoceptually perceive valence? E.g. distinguishing excitement from nervousness.

* How strong is the evidence for emotional granularity? I've only found cross-sectional and follow-up studies in Barrett's book
