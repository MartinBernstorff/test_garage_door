# Design systems that align emotions with cognitions
This is essentially modulating [[Motivational Intensity]] (the emotion) to fit with what we find most important (the cognition) – [[Set goals effectively]].

What does this mean, then? It means to: 
* [[Design systems that support valuing its actions]]
* [[Design systems that decrease impulsiveness]]
* [[Design systems that support expectancy]] 

From [[The Motivation Equation]]:

How similar is this to OIT? [[OIT is about cognitions, not emotions]]. This is important, because it determines whether “how to integrate motivations” from Roam can be used to inform which systems to design here.

This is essentially two problems; clarify cognitions, select them, and implement systems that motivate emotions in the same direction.

Q. You notice your emotions are poorly aligned with your cognitions. What materials have you collected for re-alignment?
