# Increase reusability
Why? Because it decreases time spent solving the same problem. This may decrease the probability of finding the optimal solution ([[Ability to reload a solution decreases maximum quality of solutions]]), but it does so while giving the benefits of dramatically decreased time spent exploring the problem space – and exploring the same part of the problem space.

[[How do I optimise reuseability in my knowledge work]]

For reuseability in academic work, there are some limitations, eg. avoiding self-plagiarism.

Different stages will require different methods:
* [[Optimise reuseability in litterature review]]
* [[Optimise reuseability in results generation]]
* [[Optimise reuseability in workflow]]

One way is to [[Increase standardisation]].

## Backlinks
* [[Minimise waste]]
	* [[Increase reusability]]
* [[Ability to reload a solution decreases maximum quality of solutions]]
	* From [[Bernstein 2018]], shows that if we’re looking to find the optimum solution, ability to refer to previous solutions is not necessarily a good idea. However, in real-world scenarios we often want to [[Increase reusability]] because the solutions we have are adequate. Furthermore, speed is often way more important than finding the optimal solution – eg. producing a computer is way more important than finding the best way of producing a computer. Collaboration and storage work way better for speed, [[Collaboration speeds up problem solving]].
