# 9-Dec-2021 - Review
*Work*
* Banking
	* Not exactly work-like, so somewhat of a distraction. Pretty good to get out of my head, though, so unsure about whether I want to change the strategy.

* Helping out with stats
	* Quite a lot of fun! Not my core job, but the kind of thing that’s likely to pay off in the long run, and is a lot of fun. If it starts to intrude more time-wise, it’s important to leverage it into career capital.

* Programming
	* Some areas with pain-points
		* Spending time formatting – for this, RStudio is better in default, and will allow a format button in the future. Maybe it’s even possible to format on save? 

		* Bug-tracing and squashing. [[Unit testing \/ test driven development \/ TDD in R]] is definitely worth doing. 

		* Waiting for code to run. I think this project is nearing finalisation, but look into [[Targets (R)]] if undertaking basically anything in the future. 
			* The major challenge is getting the dataframes into the environment, but that should be very easy if they’re cached to disk! 
				* As soon as we’re allowed to do that, which I can probably do already, we’re golden!
				* Alternatively, we might be able to cache to MidtX.
	* For learning to improve, I might be able to stream straight to Twitch, and use that during my daily review. Definitely worthwhile, but will compromise data safety. [[10-Dec-21 - Work]]

*Homely*
* Strongly prefer using my iPad over my computer, keeps me *much* more focused!

* Nothing much else to add, very happy with this change. 

* Next time I get home, might want to experiment more with programming or other ways to answer [[Which competences do I want to explore for my Vision for Work?]].
