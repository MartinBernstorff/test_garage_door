## Backlinks
* [[Do I want to implement an Evergreen-like system (like Andy Matuschak's)]]
	* Using Roam for reference management seems useful given their in-line back-linking feature, specifically for each figure in the document. However, it may be possible here â€“ all I'd have to do is create a file for each document, then link to the hypothesis right under the figure. For example, see [[Bonvanie 2017]].
