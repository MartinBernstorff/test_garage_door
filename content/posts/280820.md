Even if I expect my future to be ordinary, I think I'd rather have an ordinary future without children than one with them.

I'm unsure about whether this holds if it means I won't find a life partner.

I think I could still be happy if we had a child, but I think I could be even happier if I found someone like Mieke, who didn't want children. We may be too young to compromise on this, too large an [[Explore or Exploit problem]] interval left to commit.
