# Turn knowledge into behaviour
[[Action makes knowledge useful]], so we want the knowledge that we acquire to be turned into behaviour that improves our lives.

For action to improve our lives, it must happen ([[How to change behaviour]]) and it must be aligned with our values ([[Take action on your values to live a meaningful life]]).
