# Number of stages in promote script
A small improvement to [[$Promote ideas by relevance]].

*07/11/2020*
However, as it is right now (since I promote based on when I want something different to work on), the number of stages is too high. It makes it so that the delay from getting an idea to considering working on it is too low, eg. it violates [[Keep ideas timely]].
