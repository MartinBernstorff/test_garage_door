[Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms by David J.C. MacKay](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201357.Information_Theory_Inference_and_Learning_Algorithms)

Especially its introduction to [[§Information Theory]]. Might answer questions like:
* What do we mean formally by “information”
* How do we design ML algorithms that are likely to capture the relevant information

Technical, but probably highly interesting!
