# Taskheat vs TimeHero
Right now, the informational feedback I get from TimeHero is going to be incredibly valuable due to me working from home, which gives me a ton of extra distractions and way less positive feedback on the work I do.

It makes planning much harder! So ideally, I want planning to be done in Taskheat, and then synced with TimeHero. How much manual processing will that require?    

Really all I can import into TimeHero is the name, duration, start and due date and assignee. This creates tons of problems for a potential import; if I update all tasks, I’ll have to update dependencies all the time. If I update only the actionable tasks, I’ll switch between paths all the time, running into problems with [[Balance context switching]].

So instead what I’m gonna have to do is to create a task each time I start something new. This runs into some psychological problems, eg. duration estimates being affected by how much energy I have at the time, making them less informational :-(

Instead, I can add task duration to titles in Taskheat! This’ll decouple those two factors. [[Keep planning and execution separated]]
