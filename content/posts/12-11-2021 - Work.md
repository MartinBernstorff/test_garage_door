# 12/11/2021 - Work
*How am I feeling today?*
Okay, nothing special. Looking forward to spending the afternoon/evening with Pernille. The meta-work I did yesterday is not what gets me going; programming, methods and producing stuff is! I hope spending the time yesterday was worth it, time will tell – albeit estimating the counterfactual is difficult!

Today, then, I will do the opposite. Lots of technical, programming and implementation work! Also looking forward to spending the afternoon/evening with Pernille.
