Crossfit combines cardio and strength, but optimises neither. Instead, I want to do cardio with hardball, and strength training in-between to maintain mass and prevent injuries.

So something like:

Cardio
Strength
Cardio

Cardio
Strength
Cardio

Where cardio is the couch to 10k program, and strength is an A/B split consisting of:

A
	Bench
	Squat
	Accessories

B
	Deadlift	
	Pull-ups
	Accessories

Run and proper strength training instead?
