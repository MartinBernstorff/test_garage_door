# Fatigue by lack of willpower
[[Ego depletion]]

Given heavy evidence against the resource-based ego-depletion model (see [Hagger, M. S. /et al./](papers3://publication/doi/10.1177/1745691616652873)) and casuistic studies showing that applying executive function doesn't necessarily result in the feeling of effort (see [Naccache et al.](papers3://publication/doi/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.11.024)) a new model for self-control seems appropriate. The following is based heavily on [Inzlicht et al](papers3://publication/doi/10.1016/j.tics.2013.12.009) and [Kurzban et al.](papers3://publication/doi/10.1017/S0140525X12003196)
