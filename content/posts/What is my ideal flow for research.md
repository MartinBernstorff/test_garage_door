# What is my ideal flow for research
Eg. I am at home and have half an hour to kill. How do I make it the easiest to find something useful to read and take notes on it?

Maybe the suggestion-emails should go to a separate email â€“ it's likely my motivation will be based on vaguely remembering an interesting question, and for that to be useful (without adding interference from access to all emails), the suggestions need to be browseable.

I want to make it easy to open a corresponding note on iOS, perhaps by using Open URL (examples here: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/2writer-ios-create-or-open-daily-note-shortcut/2222)
