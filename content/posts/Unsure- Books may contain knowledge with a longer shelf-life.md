# Unsure: Books may contain knowledge with a longer shelf-life
If we’re looking for “general wisdom”, this is probably true if:
* The book is older
* The book is still being recommended

Otherwise, it’s more about quality of the content than about the medium.

However, “general wisdom” is often based on self-fulfilling prophecies or folklore, which may or may not be true. This means that the long shelf life doesn’t necessarily reflect ground truths, but may reflect ground truths about humans.
