## Career planning
Plan in ABZ mode.

> If you’re very uncertain, make a plan to do more research while building flexible career capital.
A: Primary explorations
B: Nearby options
Z: Fallback in case everything goes wrong

Build relevant career capital. Find which option matters most to you, then ask the people in charge of hiring what determined which candidate they selected last time they hired.

Review plan at least once a year - your world is going to change.

### The first path - an ultra-clear answer
Setting goals

> The first guideline, then, is to study the nature of what you are signing up for, and begin to cut things that don’t fit with it. For defined paths, you can usually see to some extent how much freedom and leisure you have, whereas for an inventor, artist, entrepreneur, scientist, statesman, or any role with potentially infinite challenge, it’s harder to know where the lines ought to be drawn.Yet, just acknowledging this fact —the fact that lines must be drawn if you have some overwhelmingly important meaningful thing in your life that you must do —just acknowledging this starts the process of looking for what supports and aids you walking the path, and what does not.
What is my greatest hidden parameter? Probably first impression and connecting with people - I'll need to practice listening and stoicism. Smile,be genuinely interested, but don't compromise on what t matters most to you.

### The second path - unclear, but getting proximate.
You will have to accumulate wins for signalling and motivation. One way of doing this is setting proximate objectives.

Decide what success looks like. Then start setting successively more proximate goals.

### The third path - resource mode
Do something, to get feedback and to build resources. This allows you to bring all your resources to bear when you find something meaningful.

Further, if something reaches 90% complete, finish it. You want to be the kind of person who wins, because it shows trustworthiness. Not having wins to show looks untrustworthy as all hell.

Select proximate objectives - they have a much higher likelihood of success, and therefor can allow you to snowball more quickly.

## What does a fulfilling career look like?
1. Work you’re good at,
2. Work that helps others,
3. Engaging work that lets you enter a state of flow (freedom, variety, clear tasks, feedback),
4. Supportive colleagues,
5. No major negatives like long hours or unfair pay, and
6. Work that fits your personal life.

## Which career will I be good at?
It’s really hard to work out what you’re going to be good at ahead of time, especially just by “going with your gut”. So instead, go investigate. After an initial cut-down of your options, go learn more and then try them out.

Minimize the costs of trying out your options by trying things in the best order (e.g. corporate sector before non-profit sector.

Keep adapting your plan over time. Think like a scientist investigating a hypothesis.

## How to have work that helps others
Yes, some work is extremely impactful.

Definition of helping others:
> The number of people whose lives you improve, and how much you improve them.

## Which problems matter most?
How well does scientific literacy fit this bill?
Or effective altruism advocacy?
