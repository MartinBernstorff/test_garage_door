# Choose goals wisely
Choose your goals wisely. [[Goal setting makes failure more painful]], so don't commit to goals before you're confident in your plan.

Goal-setting works largely by [[Goal setting increases focus]]. This can backfire if you're in a novel or changing environment, since the newfound focus means that [[Goal setting decreases flexibility]]. Even worse, having only a long-term goal in a turbulent environment actually decreases performance (Latham 1999).

Lastly, [[Desires amplify suffering when they aren't satisfied]], and even [[Some desires are mirages of our values]].
