# Antifragile
Systems that are closely coupled and efficient have small buffers and little redundancy, which makes them vulnerable to chance events. This means that chance events can't occur â€“ we need extremely accurate forecasting.

However, in many areas of life, this isn't possible. So we should become antifragile instead.

Detecting fragility is easy
We should design for chance events, even to profit from them
