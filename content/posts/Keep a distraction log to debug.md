# Keep a distraction log to debug
* Look for the emotion that precedes every distraction. Try to figure out your internal trigger.

* Write it down. Include details like the time of day, what were you doing and how you felt then.

* Explore the negative sensation with curiosity instead of contempt; You're only observing now.

* Be extra aware of *liminal moments*: Transitions that moves us from one thing to another throughout our day. 
	* Like opening another (distracting) tab in your web browser because you got annoyed at how long the first tab took to load. Try to eliminate these, or figure out why you're vulnerable.
