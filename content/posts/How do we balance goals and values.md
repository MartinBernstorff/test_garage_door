# How do we balance goals and values
Goals are end-states, so they are finite. But we can't guarantee that we'll succeed, and it's often hard to stay on track.

There are also cases where we can't meaningfully act on our goals; when you're sitting in traffic, you can't work on your essay. Values, however, are always available.

If we [[Use values to select goals]], we can live by both. It's rather a question of prioritising, of balancing values and selecting the right goals ([[Â§Prioritisation]]).

* [[Action menus can facilitate choice]]
	* The point is to spend your time and focus in the way that you think is right, and to make it as easy as possible to do so. That means to do so either by your values or your goals ([[How do we balance goals and values]]).
