# $My research production process
This is the implementation of [[§Scientific Productivity]].

The process consists of multiple phases: [[Shape research ideas]], [[Betting table for research]], [[Produce research papers]] and [[Disseminate research knowledge]]. The justification for each phase is in each link.

It all starts with a new idea or a new problem, typically arisen from [[$My note system]]. This is then developed into a more mature research idea:
* [[Shape research ideas]]
	* [[Define the research problem]]
	* [[Shape the research strategy]]

As we start to gather more research ideas, it’s time to sit down to:
* [[Betting table for research]]

Then we:
* [[Produce research papers]]
	* [[Scope the paper]]
	* [[Do the work for a paper]]
	* [[Learn from research outcomes]]

* [[Disseminate research knowledge]]

This doesn’t mean that this process is irreversible, or that every idea makes it to the end. It’s a funnel, where we filter out ideas step by step.

## Backlinks
* [[How to get published]]
	* Maybe add “collaboration formation” to [[$My research production process]].
* [[Pitching out corrupts within]]
	* What might the second and third order effects of this be for work? What does it imply for research, eg. [[$My research production process]]? Or productivity?

Q. What are the 4 major parts in your research production process?
A. [[Shape research ideas]], [[Betting table for research]], [[Produce research papers]] and [[Disseminate research knowledge]].

Q. Which two phases does [[Shape research ideas]] consist of?
A. [[Define the research problem]], [[Shape the research strategy]].

Q. Why might we [[Shape the research strategy]] before the [[Betting table for research]]?
A. To better prioritise.
