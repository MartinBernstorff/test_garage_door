# Do I want to use Bear ID instead of my own UUID solution?
Advantages
* Generated automatically on note creation
* Don’t take up visual space in Bear

Disadvantages
* Resetting of the review process of my Anki personal mnemonic medium cards
	* It’s a total of 226 reviews, or roughly 20 minutes. I can live with that.
* Programming time, I expect less than 20 minutes

If I switch away from Bear, I don’t think it’ll be a huge issue. I can just start generating my own UUIDs within the same area again.
