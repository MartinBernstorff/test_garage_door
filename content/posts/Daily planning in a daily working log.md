# Daily planning in a daily working log
This allows for me to set intentions while also making it highly free-form, adaptive to what I think is right for the given day.

It does miss out on some of [[Intention as context]], e.g. having the activities show up when opening a tab in Brave, but it's worth a shot! Might make the planning more enjoyable and less forced.

	* I probably want to add these small tasks to the daily plan, so that I remember them and [[Close open loops]], without getting distracted by doing the activity right now. That is one of the major advantages of [[Daily planning in a daily working log]], it is such low [[Â§Friction]] that you can do that without a large loss to overhead.
