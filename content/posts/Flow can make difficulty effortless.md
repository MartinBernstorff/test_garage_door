# Flow can make difficulty effortless
I’m not quite sure whether this is right. 

Flow requires that the activity is challenging, but not too difficult. In that sense, [[Proficiency enables flow]]. If we become more competent at a task, we can reach flow with it.

But difficulty ([[§Difficulty]]) becomes more salient as task difficulty increases. When difficulty arises, that task may already be at too high a difficulty for flow. Or it may not – my experience has been that if there are few distractions, good feedback (and the other criteria for flow).

How does this backtest?
