# §Elaborative encoding
Elaborative encoding is the principle that elaborating on a concept encodes it more strongly in long-term memory.

This is one of the reasons that [[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]].

## Backlinks
* [[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]
	* One reason for this is [[§Elaborative encoding]]. Linking notes densely means that we get in the habit of relating what we're writing about to what we already know. This improves retention.
* [[?How many prompts should I write]]
	* But don’t collect too little, either! If an idea is truly important, writing the prompts is *much* easier when you have all the nodes in your mind. And if you connect the information, [[§Elaborative encoding]] strengthens the memories further.
* [[Suspend poorly phrased high interval cards]]
	* It’s also likely not that expensive. Cards that are highly mature are also likely more stable, better encoded to other memories ([[§Elaborative encoding]]). This means that they’re more likely to survive on their own. 
* [[Cloze deletion prompts seem to produce less understanding than question-answer pairs in spaced repetition memory systems]]
	* When I’m using cloze deletions, it’s typically for information where conceptual knowledge will not solve the problem, e.g. which tests to order for some disease. In this case, conceptual knowledge can help through [[§Elaborative encoding]], but given the speed with which I need to produce the information, it’s rarely enough.
	* Cloze deletions aren’t effortful to write, so they don’t induce as much [[§Elaborative encoding]]
* [[Elaborative encoding is high utility]]
	* Works through [[§Elaborative encoding]]; when you elaborate on the reason of a stated fact, you tend to remember it better, especially if you relate it both in similarity and difference to other facts.
* [[08/11/2021 - Home]]
	* At low levels in the hierarchy, its very hard to memorise. By definition, you don’t do [[§Elaborative encoding]], because you don’t . On the other hand, the information is incredibly flexible - if you can list the characteristics of two diseases, its very easy to compare those two sets.
* [[Ask to explain]]
	* You can guide them with questions, but you can't just explain it to them. That leads to low retention, basically missing out on [[§Elaborative encoding]]. 
	* Q. Why might asking questions to explain something lead to better retention?
* [[For a prompt with "more" response, how do I select strategy]]
	* It means I want to integrate the knowledge more deeply into who I am. This opens multiple strategies, like [[Entrainment]], or repeating the prompt more frequently, or [[§Elaborative encoding]], or rephrasing the prompt.
