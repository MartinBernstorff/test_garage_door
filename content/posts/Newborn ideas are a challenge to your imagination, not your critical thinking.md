# Newborn ideas are a challenge to your imagination, not your critical thinking
[[New-born ideas are fragile]], so they aren't great targets for critical thinking. They need to mature. 

But! Just like newborns, they're often rife with opportunity! They can become something new you've never considered, and they're tremendously moldable to become even better.

Q. Someone is suggesting an idea new to you. How might you approach it?
A. As a challenge to your imagination! How might this hold merit? What can this idea do?

Q. When does it make sense to subject a new idea to criticism?
A. After it has matured a bit and we think it's good
