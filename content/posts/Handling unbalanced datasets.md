# Handling unbalanced datasets
<!-- #anki/deck/ML -->

If you dataset includes many more of a given class than another, that class will affect the training algorithm a lot. But that may not be what you want – you may want to be better at predicting eg. “stroke” than “no stroke”. 

How do you handle this?

Q. How can you increase the weight of a given class when training an ML algorithm?
A. 1) Over-sampling, 2) Under-sampling of other classes, 3) Arithmetically in the algorithm
