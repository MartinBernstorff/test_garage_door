# Hill climbing is useful for optimisation
Eg. when I visualise a search problem as exploring a landscape looking for hills, it's really an optimisation problem – the more broadly the problem to optimise is framed, the bigger the difference between local optima.

To apply this to research, hill climbing is improving on a research idea – but to escape the local maximum, we need to look for new ideas and continue with them, even though they looked less promising (jitter), or starting from scratch with new ideas, or using a little bit of randomness every time (the Metropolis algorithm).
