# Quality check at low value
A general idea for [[Quality checks]], you want to test things at the lowest possible value – ie. when you’ve invested as little energy into them as possible, but enough for the idea to stand on its own.

This is part of [[Shape the strategy]] and related to [[Perform cheap experiments]]. 

How do I implement this in the ideation phase of research?     
---

Q. When in the process do you want to quality check ideas?
A. At as low fidelity as possible, but as high as necessary.

Q. What is my coinage for a concept very close to [[Fail Fast]]?
A. [[Quality check at low value]]

	* Already at this stage, it makes sense to [[Quality check at low value]], [[Prototyping for research ideas]].
* [[§Test driven development (TDD)]]
	* The idea to [[Quality check at low value]]. It’s a way of scaffolding [[§Informational feedback]].
	* Software is less costly to create, because you catch bugs and differences in requiements/expectations early ([[Quality check at low value]]). Known as defect prevention.
* [[Probe the approach]]
	* After you [[Shape the strategy]], you're typically enamoured with what you've thought up. If this is about improving something (rather than having fun, which is valid!), it's time to be skeptical. You want to [[Quality check at low value]], and now is the time.
* [[§Writing a research idea pitch]]
	* You want it to be as minimal as possible, so you can [[Quality check at low value]]. What are the minimal constituents of such a pitch?

* [[Backtest principles]]
	* This is the ultimate version of [[Quality check at low value]]. It allows you to simulate an idea early.

* [[Consume collected information quickly]]
	* This limits overhead from collecting material on paths that you don't want to explore, or collecting material with large overlap ([[Curate inflow of information]], [[Quality check at low value]], [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]]).

* [[Validate research ideas when you scope the paper]]
	* On the one hand, you want to [[Quality check at low value]] to discard output at its lowest value stage, so you don't spend time doing eg. [[Scope the paper]] with ideas that don't work.

	* In the spirit of [[Quality check at low value]], I want to pitch research ideas to a few select people. 
* [[Extreme Programming Pocket Guide by chromatic]]
	* The more rapid feedback is, the easier it is to [[Quality check at low value]].
* [[How might hill charts help me in planning what to do?]]
	* It also helps with which challenges to tackle first - problems you’re uncertain about need to go to the top of the hill as fast as possible, so that you can encounter critical uncertainties early [[Quality check at low value]].

	* Speed is valuable mostly (only?) if it results in faster learning ([[Quality check at low value]]) or better decisions.
* [[Stay flexible when ideating]]
