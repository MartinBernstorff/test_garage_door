# Clearer process misses the point; what matters is better outcomes
I fear that I have a tendency to make processes clearer and more explicit (eg. [[§Problem solving]] and [[$My research system]], without keeping in mind whether this clarification actually improves the process.

Clearer processes does allow for clearer thinking around them; we create models and vocabulary that we didn’t have before. But it also takes quite a bit of time. [[Optimisation needs to be worth it]].
