This is interesting! One hypothesis is that much of our problem-solving happens sub-consciously. This idea-presentation then is the same as [[Insight problem solving]]. But does it have implications?

Probably not really. It's just an interesting phenomenon in how I [[Shape the strategy]] and [[Do the work]]. Insight is an input, but it's rarely the full solution â€“ and I can get insight into problems that are not worth solving, ie. where when I [[Validate the appetite]], it doesn't fit.
