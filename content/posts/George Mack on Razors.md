# George Mack on Razors
A twitter thread, definitely worthwhile to find!

[A Thread from @george__mack: “THREAD: 15 of the most useful razors and rules I’ve found. Rules of thumb that simplify …”](https://threader.app/thread/1350513143387189248)

Skinner’s razor: There are only two ways to stop procrastination - increase the pleasure of doing the task, or increase the pain of not doing the task. 

This is a simple way to shape behavior, and isn’t incompatible with [[§SDT]]. SDT argues for an orthogonal dimension - whether the pain and pleasures are integrated and autonomous, or whether they’re forced upon us.

*Selecting between options*
* Regret minimisation

* Luck maximization 
When stuck with two equal options, go for the one with the highest probability of being lucky. We tend to dramatically underestimate the value of extreme outcomes (is that true?), so maximising for them maximises total happiness. 
	* Wouldn’t this also mean that we should almost always break up with a partner and go for someone else?
