# Auto-scheduling limits analysis paralysis
By selecting tasks that fit a bunch of parameters, auto-scheduling makes an objectively good choice about which task to handle at a specific time. This makes it at least a modifier of [[Analysis paralysis]]

Furthermore, by off-loading task-selection to the computer, it makes it easier for humans to get more done since [[Auto-schedulers remove cognitive overhead from calendar constraints]].

The problem, though, is that [[Auto-scheduling decreases satisfaction of autonomy]].

## Backlinks
* [[$Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]]
	* This means that I can take advantage of [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]] and [[Auto-scheduling limits analysis paralysis]].
* [[$Auto-schedulers]]
	* [[Auto-scheduling limits analysis paralysis]], almost entirely eliminating it if you're relying on a specific schedule. But that's mostly because I haven't yet internalized that [[$Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]].
