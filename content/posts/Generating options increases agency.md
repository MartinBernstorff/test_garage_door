# Generating options increases agency
[[If you define the menu, you shape the choices]]

Making a choice includes generating the options, weighing them and choosing.

If you don't generate your own options, you run into the problems outlined in [[Balance searching for and making your own solutions]], eg.: 
* The options provided don't fit as well with your life as they could
* Your motivations aren't fully integrated
