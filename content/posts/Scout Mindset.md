# Scout Mindset
Chesterton's fence: To advocate for changing something, you must first understand it. Otherwise you're likely to cause harm.

The reasons for soldier mindset: 

*Individual*
* Emotional comfort (sour grapes or sweet lemons)

* Self-esteem, morale, social persuasion, image and belonging

To get honest feedback on a disagreement, describe it without saying which side you are on.

Counterfactual world tests. Remember to vividly describe or imagine it. 

* The double standard test: If someone from a different group did this, what would you think? Especially helpful if you dislike the other group.

* The outsider test: If someone intelligent, wise and strong was in your shoes, what would they do?

* The conformity test: If less than half of people did what you are considering doing, would you still do it?

* Status quo bias test: If you were already in this new situation, would you be tempted to go back?

Coping strategies without self-deception:
* Remember how far you've come
* Count your blessings
* Remember that you can't do more than your best 

You don't need self-deception to be happy. The articles typically ask people about character traits, and if they think they're better than average, conclude that they're self-deceiving. But they might also just be better than average! 

Self-deception about probability of success makes it impossible to choose between goals (benefit to cost).

One of the most motivating things is to keep looking for, and making, smart bets.

Psyching up:
* Paint a vivid picture

* Set ambitious goals

* Show emotion
