I've been terribly hungover today.

I had a very good time yesterday, especially with the data science books. Just a few regrets: I displayed overly masculine behaviour at Broca's bar, especially when I was doing push-ups and I did to the drop-down dancing bit that's hard on my knees.

Also, the benefits of getting truly drunk are very slim. The drawbacks, are very real. I got almost nothing out of of today.
