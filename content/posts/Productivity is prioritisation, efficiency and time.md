# Productivity is prioritisation, efficiency and time
[[§Prioritisation]]  x Efficiency x Time

[[§Prioritisation]] is about selecting the right objectives. This requires that we:
1. Know where we ultimately want to go, i.e. a [[§Vision]] 
2. Are good at selecting the right actions for getting there, i.e. [[§Effectiveness]].

[[§Efficiency]] is about getting the most output pr. unit time.

And lastly, time.
