# Supports cloze deletions
May be possible by using the cloze note type in genanki. It's model_type=CLOZE

Currently, cards are produced by processing the file line by line and adding cards from the separators.

I probably want to move away from this paradigm, and instead add the entire file content (or close) to the first field, and then see if genanki can extract the cloze fields.
