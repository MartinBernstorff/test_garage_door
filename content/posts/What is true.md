# What is true?
The correspondence theory of truth — that whatever corresponds to observable reality is true.
The coherence theory of truth —  that claims are true if they follow logically and coherently from a set of axioms (or intermediate propositions).
The consensus theory of truth — that what is true is what everyone agrees to be true.
The pragmatic theory of truth — that what is true is what is useful to you, or beneficial for you.

When might pragmatic theories of truth result in erroneous conclusions? Why do I skoff at it?
