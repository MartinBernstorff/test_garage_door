# D: It's hard to start writing Evergreens
It's rather hard to get started on writing each morning. Since motivation waxes and wanes and ambiguity is the enemy of initiation, you want the behaviour to be easy to initiate and you want to turn it into a habit ([[When having clarified values, put in habits in service of those values]]).

Having a specific routine, like [[§Incremental thinking]], can make it much easier to get started. It runs the risk of [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], but since the postpone mechanism is lightweight, it may circumvent it. The best way to know is to try. 

Furthermore, if the work is integrated, the structure and scaffolding that [[§Incremental thinking]] can provide is  a strength. 

<!-- #curiosity/researchable How might scaffolding in the SDT sense allow us to live better, fuller lives? (Does it connect with goal-setting and systems design?) -->
