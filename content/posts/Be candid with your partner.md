We're already pretty good at communicating honestly. We can talk about our challenges very explicitly, and try to troubleshoot them together.

Sometimes Mieke runs into [[Argue about opinions, not people]], at least subconsciously, and can get very hurt from having an idea criticised.

This has been tough for me because I've wanted to avoid negative affect, but [[Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering]].

Instead, [[Act through discomfort]] and [[Don't judge someone for their emotions]].

	* However, [[Be candid with your partner]], and be trustworthy. When you ask my opinion, you know that you'll get the truth, that I'll [[Give advice on strategy]].  I also want to be forthcoming, [[Share concerns with your partner]], so that we can troubleshoot together.
