# Which groupings exist within MHC
We can examine this question by:
1. Cluster analysis
2. Correlation analysis
3. PCA

*Cluster analysis* allows us to check for actual clusters, eg. are there three groups: those with somatic symptoms, those with psychiatric symptoms and those with both.

This can be interesting insofar that we can check which diagnoses the categories get – if those with somatic symptoms have increased psychiatric diagnoses compared to those with few symptoms, it indicates that the HBSC-SCL scale captures ill-being beyond the symptoms that are included.
These analysis are going to take some thought if I am to relate them to MHC. One way would be to highlight which categories participants with MHC are most likely to belong to, eg. if they are more likely to belong to the "mixed" cluster, this tells us that MHC most likely captures more genral ill-being.

*Correlation analysis* (by this I probably mean something like a cloud plot or an n x p heatmap with the psychiatric and somatic symptoms on each axis).

One hypothesis is that there is a group with many somatic complaints, one with many psychiatric complaints, and one with both. This is supported by sufficient model fit both as a one- and twodimensional model, and can be examined by the above mentioned plot.

*PCA* could validate that two-dimensional structure found within the HBSC-SCL.
