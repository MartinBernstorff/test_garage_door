# Cross-validation vs. Validation sets
In my understanding, validation sets are for:
1. Choosing the best model
2. Tuning hyperparameters

But how is it better than cross-validation? And what does that mean for our project?

It saves computational resources!

Q. When might we use [[Â§Cross-validation]] instead of a validation set?
A. When data is more sparse than computational resources.
