*Ideas*
Which level to practice is a trade-off.

Arbitrary hierarchy:
1. Details about an object
2. How an object relates to other objects
	1. E.g. explaining why the details have arisen, or
	2. 
3. How categories of objects relate to other categories

At low levels in the hierarchy, its very hard to memorise. By definition, you don’t do [[§Elaborative encoding]], because you don’t . On the other hand, the information is incredibly flexible - if you can list the characteristics of two diseases, its very easy to compare those two sets.

How do we typically learn which categories an object fits into? Via lots of examples. It’d be great if that were possible with SRS, especially for diagnoses.
