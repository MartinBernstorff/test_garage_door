# §Work
Which questions do I care about here? Probably something like:
* [[How hard should I work?]]
* How should I relate to my work
	* Stances around choice
		* Is it something that I have to do
		* Something that I choose to do?
	* Stances around desire
		* How hard should I work?
			* Should I stop working when I don't enjoy it?
			* Should I stop work when I don't find it meaningful?
			* [[What separates lack of passion/enjoyment from laziness?]]
		* Should I strive for steady, routine-work? (Eg. X hours pr. week)

How does ACT relate to these? 

And how does Meaningness? 

How about [[On work ethic]], and SDT?

And how about me?
