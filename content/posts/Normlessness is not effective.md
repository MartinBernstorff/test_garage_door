# Normlessness is not effective
Having no norms at all leads to radical acceptance, but it also means that you can't reap the benefits of having [[Â§Accountability]].

Rather, what you want is a group of people that all have the same, useful norms for them. Then they can support each other, both in the sense of keeping each other accountable, and in the sense of lovingly supporting when things don't go as they're intended to.

This might sound harsh, and can lead to conflicts. There's something in SDT about showing disapproval without challenging intrinsic worth - consider reading up on that.
