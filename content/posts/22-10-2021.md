We wake up together, as our alarm clocks go off. This is by necessity; we have children to get ready, dogs to walk, work to do.

And while we’re tired, we’re also happy. We’re satisfied because the world is a better place due to the stuff we do.

We get the children ready, make breakfast, and walk the dog. Then we go, ideally by bike, to drop off the kids and go to work.

[[§My Vision for an Ideal Workday]]

One of us picks up the kids, as the other one gets started on dinner. Then we separate to do our things, except some days where we play a game or watch a movie.

We spend some time together in the evening, chatting, maybe taking a walk. Then we go to sleep.

*Which challenges might I face in making this a reality?*
* Unstable work environment: Become a GP or do data-science, [[§My Vision for Work]]

* Insufficient time – see above, as well as [[Strategies for saving time]]. Many of these require money, so a good income is important in this context as well. As a way of saving time, [[Save time by shortening commute]]. This requires enough money to buy a house close to your work, so that’s another focus.

* Insufficient time alone – [[Strategies for saving time]], as well as adding introversion/need for alone time to [[§My Vision for a Partnership]].
