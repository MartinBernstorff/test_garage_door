	* [[$My reading system]]
* [[Add more emphasis on the reading and research of material connected to notes]]
	* This is to support [[Building requires repeated attention]] through [[$My reading system]] and [[$My note system]]. Currently, much of what I do is not connected to anything previous. And some of the most interesting things I have are associated with something I've selected previously, eg. the Kahnemann paper.
