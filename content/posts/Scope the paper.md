# Scope the paper
When scoping the paper, you want to:
* Find research problems that fit into a common theme
* [[Validate research ideas]]
* Hammer the scope to fit it into one paper

To make it easier for co-authors, itâ€™s probably a good idea to combine the research idea-pitches into a paper pitch.

## Backlinks
* [[$My research production process]]
	* [[Scope the paper]]
* [[Shape the research strategy]]
	* ## When you have done this a sufficient amount of times, you want to [[Scope the paper]].
* [[Validate research ideas when you scope the paper]]
	* Should we [[Probe the research problem]] and [[Probe the research approach]] during [[Shape research ideas]], or during [[Scope the paper]]?
	* On the one hand, you want to [[Quality check at low value]] to discard output at its lowest value stage, so you don't spend time doing eg. [[Scope the paper]] with ideas that don't work.
