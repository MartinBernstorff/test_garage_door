# §My execution system
Right now it's a combination of [[Complice.co]], [[Sunsama]] and [[§TimeHero]].

We want software that is as simple as possible, but as complicated as required.

[[§My execution system for work]]
[[§My execution system for recreation]]

I’ll definitely want to use [[Complice.co]]. Of important features it is lacking:
+ [[Recognise dependencies]] - [[§Taskheat]]

[[Close open loops]] 
	- For work - [[Sunsama]]/[[§Taskheat]] 
		- But what about small misc. tasks?
	- For leisure

[[Intention as context]] - [[Complice.co]]/[[Sunsama]]
	- [[Improve intention as context]]

[[Use time continuously]]
	+ For work - [[Sunsama]]
	- For leisure - ?

[[Balance daily bandwidth]]
	- For work - [[Sunsama]]
	- For leisure - ?
	([[Informational feedback for daily work]])

+ [[Balance weekly bandwidth]] - I can probably live without this right now
- [[Balance long-term bandwidth]] - I can probably live without this right now

What the software needs to do depends on:
* [[§Activity types]]
* [[§Executing well]]

You should modify your workflow based on what is necessary at a given time. 



Sunsama and TimeHero are about how to fit those goals into a messy life. 

TimeHero helps with balancing bandwidth over time and making sure that essential tasks aren't forgotten in the cracks. Automatic scheduling can help with that.

It also helps me with tasks that I want to be reminded about in the future, and which don't have a specific date they need to get done by.

Sunsama is about balancing agency and scheduling. It's making choices about how and when things matter, and manually making sure that the activities can actually get done within a reasonable timeframe. It's complice with slightly more quantification, it's making sure that my time spent on work isn't too high (or too low).

	* What does this imply for [[§My execution system]]? Probably that I don’t want to maximise time spent at all. Rather, I want to keep it steady around a given level, and to change it up and down depending on how I feel. I want to [[Align emotions and cognitions]], and use that to adjust time spent.
