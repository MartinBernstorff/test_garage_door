# §Weekly planning
Something I want to do? Increases staleness, but might allow me to make more strategic choices.

The primary advantage is the same as in [[§Goal Setting]]; increased focus and more effort, especially as the goals become more focused.

It might make me less flexible and have less fun, though. However, these high-level considerations are probably useful.

## Backlinks
* [[§Monthly planning]]
	* Like [[§Weekly planning]], but with even longer time-horizons.
* [[Implementation: Stack of Possibilities]]
	* I might use this for longer-term planning too, e.g. having a hashtag for each week and month which I can search in using the Alfred extension and “bw” and “bm”. This could expand pretty well, while maintaining high flexibility! [[§Weekly planning]], [[§Monthly planning]].
