Might summaries be an effective version of books, given that we process them thoroughly?

Many of the arguments against summaries go away with thorough processing. Summaries are said not to change behavior as well, bu that can be somewhat remedied with the personal mnemonic medium. Summaries are said to not give as thorough and understanding, but if you do your own thinking, you not only understand the arguments - you integrate them into your model of the world.

Reading just the summary gives you the time to cover more ground, whereas the deeper processing allows to catch up on drawing the map.

This goes especially for gears-level understanding books, not so much if itâ€™s something experiential.
