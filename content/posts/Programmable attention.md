# Programmable attention
The idea that you can set up systems to affect where your attention goes, eg. changing your media streams (Fraidycat/Twitter).

Beware that [[Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is]], so you want the ideal system to bias towards consuming and contemplating the media, but without making it feel forced.

One example is [[How do I keep ideas, books and other non-obligations salient]].
