Seeking to use our talents to manifest glory for the benefit of ourselves and others. It is using our abilities to benefit others.

* [[§My Vision of Myself as a Partner]]
	* I want to be intellectually curious. To see problems as challenges, as something that we can work on together. Not that we have to challenge every problem, but to find most of them interesting (whether they be in our relationship or in the world), and to select those that matter. I value [[§Nobility]], so I want to pursue greatness for the greater good. 
* [[What can Mieke and I care about together?]]
	* It seems that I care mostly about intellectual pursuits ([[Value curiosity]]) and making the world a better place ([[§Nobility]]), whereas she wants to travel, hygge and figure out her own career. 
* [[Avoid laziness]]
	* This typically leads to missing out on enjoyment, missing out on meaning and missing out on being useful. It stands in direct contrast with [[§Nobility]]. 
* [[How hard should I work?]]
	* As an alternate approach, I want to live by [[§Nobility]] and [[Enjoyable usefulness]]. As such, I should work as hard as is meaningful; seek to rise so that I can serve others.
* [[The ideal date]]
	* [[§Nobility]] can also be intuited. 
* [[Purpose]]
	* That is what [[§Nobility]] is about, and is an alternative to [[Mission]].
