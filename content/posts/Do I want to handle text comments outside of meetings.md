# Do I want to handle text comments outside of meetings
Some comments I can handle myself. Some comments require that I speak to the co-author; I can then, depending on the severity of the comment, escalate to speaking with all co-authors or just sending a note.

But writing something up typically takes way longer than just solving it verbally at the next meeting. So I will typically do that instead; unless lead time for meetings is very high.
