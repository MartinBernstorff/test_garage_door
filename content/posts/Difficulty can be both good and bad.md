# Difficulty can be both good and bad
It depends on why it is perceived as difficult – difficulty can arise because you’re chipping away at what you aren’t skilled at, or because you have no idea what you’re doing.

In that sense, the level of perceived difficulty isn’t terribly important, other than due to its motivational effects (for which keeping it moderately high is the best).

Q. When is perceived difficulty good?
A. If due to being on the edge of capability.

Q. When might perceived difficulty be problematic?
A. If missing either progress or meaning.
