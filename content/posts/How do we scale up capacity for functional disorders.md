# How do we scale up capacity for functional disorders
One way is to use a bachelor’s or master’s student. I prefer bachelor’s since they’ve most recently had the epidemiology/biostat courses. 

However, this requires that we have sufficient research ideas to feed them. 

Regarding this, open questions are:
* [[How do we scale up treatment for functional disorders]]
* [[How do we quickly refer people to treatment]]
	1. [[Do we need a doctor's diagnosis to make the treatment viable]] or [[Can we minimise doctor time spent diagnosing]]

## Backlinks
* [[How do I get co-authorships?]]
	* More information may be available at [[How do we scale up capacity for functional disorders]].
* [[Are functional disorders proper diagnoses]]
	* They do provide some degree of societal benefits (CBT free of charge, AFAIK). Given that the bottleneck is capacity at the center for functional disorders, an interesting question becomes [[How do we scale up capacity for functional disorders]].
