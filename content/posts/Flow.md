# Flow
My hypothesis:

> Flow is experienced when current projected utility of task is very high, resulting in very little time spent evaluating alternatives.

This matches neatly with the flow criteria:

1. A clear set of goals and progress – makes the utility salient
2. Clear and immediate feedback – makes the utility salient, also see [here](#feedback).
3. Perceived challenge and skills must match – if there's a mismatch, either skills are underutilized making room for a task of greater marginal utility, or the challenge is too great, decreasing the chance of success.

* [[Challenge is intrinsically motivating]]
	* One of the reasons for [[Flow]].
* [[Effort can be enjoyable]]
	* [[Flow]]
* [[Practice like a scientist, perform like an artist]]
	* Evidence can inform intuition, allowing us to get the best from empirical measurements while getting the pleasant [[Flow]] experience of [[Use heuristics]] and [[§Intuition]] ([[Intuition is emergent heuristics]]).
