# Setting goals improves well-being
Having no salient goals may be even worse than having goals that aren't fully integrated. They’re about execution, directing behaviour. Intrinsic motivation is fun, but having something we value and moving towards it is required for life satisfaction.

[[Lack of self-direction is defeating]], ie. amotivation is worse than external motivation. When that arises, we need to explore, to see if there are tasks or activities that we want to undertake and which make our lives better. We need to formulate a [[§Vision]].
