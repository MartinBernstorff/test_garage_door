# Take action on your values to live a meaningful life
The action needs to be committed, which means persistent ([[Building requires repeated attention]], [[Setbacks are not failure]]).

And it needs to be effective in building your meaningful life. This means you have to [[§Clarify your values to know which actions to take]].

You want to [[Use values to select goals]], and then [[Use goals to select actions]].

In the meantime, remember to make the most of the journey. As you're moving in a valued direction, every moment of the journey is meaningful.

This circumvents [[Delay decreases motivation]] as living according to your values is something you can do right now, and it circumvents [[Achieving goals leaves life empty]], as it's something you can do forever.

> To make this distinction clearer, consider the following story. A mother decides to take her two kids to a fantastic zoo, which happens to be a good two hours’ drive away. 
> 
> One kid has only one aim: to get to the zoo as fast as possible. All the way there he’s sitting on the edge of his seat, in a state of constant frustration, every few minutes whining, ‘Are we there, yet?’, ‘I’m bored’, ‘How much longer?’
> 
> The second kid, however, has two aims: to get to the zoo as fast as possible and to appreciate the journey. So this second kid is looking out the window, noticing all the fields full of cows and sheep, watching in fascination at the giant trucks zooming past, waving out of the window at friendly pedestrians. 
> 
> He’s not frustrated, not whining and not miserable. He’s living in the moment, appreciating where he is, rather than focusing on where he’s not.
> 
> Now if the car breaks down halfway and the kids never reach the zoo, then which child has had the most rewarding journey? And if the car does make it to the zoo, obviously both kids will have a great reward—but still, only one of them has enjoyed the journey.

Instead, [[§Clarify your values to know which actions to take]] by using that [[Your long-term emotions inform your values]], [[Emotions are emergent heuristics about actions for values]].
