# Separate work and recreation in day to day
One of the complications I imagine is that there's going to be times where I want to keep working on "work". Where it feels weird to call it work at all. 

That's OK! You can expand the work-day to accommodate that, or contract it if you need or want more recreation. It's about finding the balance that works for you, while making use of [[Compartmentalisation helps focus]].

The question, then, is: [[What I value in recreation, fun and leisure]]
