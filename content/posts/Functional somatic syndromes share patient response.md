# Functional somatic syndromes share patient response
One single diagnosis, bodily distress syndrome, succeeded to capture 10 diagnostic categories of functional somatic syndromes and somatoform disorders

Isn't this due to [[CBT works on anything]]? Ie. that most of the interventions improve well-being, which improves symptom reporting across almost all syndromes, including with organic pathology?

Some of the treatments appear highly unlikely to work on everything, eg. Tegaserod for IBS and PPI for non-ulcer dyspepsia (see Henningsen 2007).

SSRIs working on a bunch of the syndromes can be explained by:
1. Comorbid depression
2. Lack of blinding due to side-effects of the SSRIs

## Backlinks
* [[Is BDS a proper diagnosis]]
	* [[Functional somatic syndromes share patient response]] â€“ but does this indicate that they are separate from somatic syndromes, or only that interventions that improve well-being work on almost anything?
