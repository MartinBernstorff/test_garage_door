# Do we want to do multitask learning for CVD
[[Do we want to separate predictions into bleeds and clots]]

We might consider [[Multitask learning]] on clusters of those outcomes. 

However, this means that our AUC is likely not going to be very good if we’re predicting them all individually, as compared to predicting “any bleed” or “any clot”. 

We can argue for doing it anyway if it increases actionability. Is that the case?
