# Muse (app)
Two primary tenets:
* The desk is not the right place for creative thinking (implying that the iPad might be helpful)

* The structured, sterile way of managing the filesystem is not conducive to novel thought

Some limitations:
* Can’t link things together

* Hard to find things

Probably makes it unsuitable as a permanent archive, but good for creative work that is “in progress”, especially if spatial relationships are helpful. 

Unsure about whether it can fill a hole for me right now, since the archival features of e.g. [[Bear (app)]] give me a feeling of a safety net, and frequently show me thoughts I didn’t know that I’d had.
