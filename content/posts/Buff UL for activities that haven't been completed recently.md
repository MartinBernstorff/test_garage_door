Might make my days more varied, and thus more fun. Some activities I actually do want to do daily (e.g. work Anki), and they will be comparatively disadvantaged by this. 

Can lead to a bunch of activities "bubbling up" that I'm not interested in
		* Can be at least somewhat counteracted by setting their "menu" probability lower

A large part of the information, though, is contained in whether I continue to rate the activity as "time well spent".
		* But I'll still get an increase in variety, which is what I want

However, my "desired frequency" varies a lot from activity to activity. If I'm going to incorporate that, it increases complexity. 
		* Can I get around that in a meaningful way?

OTOH, a constant detractor is probably still going to be helpful. 

Currently, I'm doing a logistic function that maps based on the difference
between an "ideal" and actual frequency â€“ unless no ideal has been specified, then it maps to 0.8 for not done and 1.2 for done this week.
