# 15/11/2021 - Work
*How do I feel?*
Pretty good! Feeling happy with Pernille, and the vision I have with her, me and my work is very motivating for me. 

*Agenda*
- Prep for group meeting

- Prep for journal club

* LPR2-LPR3

* 13:00 - Group meeting

* 14:00 - Journal club

- Nourish flashcards

* Clean room for Mads

*Misc.*
* How do I handle my old cloze-deletions?
	* On the one hand, they're extremely cheap to review
	* On the other, I fear [[Retrieval prompts should discourage shallow pattern matching]]
		* But spending time rephrasing them all is probably not well invested
		* Rather, I think I'll promote both thriving and the best possible learning by re-reading the relevant books when I restart clinic
		* This implies that I should suspend the cards and focus on those that have been written as QA prompts
			* But really, I want to go after what I care about the most, i.e. [[Vision for Work: Private Sector, Data Science]]
			* This vision depends only weakly on me being a doctor, and very weakly on me demonstrating broad doctoring abilities
			* Rather, it depends on domain-specific information that I can prep before potential interviews 
				* [[JIT vs. JIC]]

* Can I create a reinforcement-learner for note-review?
	* Use #p0 and #p1 as strong predictors
	* Prompt this in the future?
	* Which heuristics should be predictors?
