# UW burnout
I draw a bunch of this from my experience doing the UW application. One explanation is that I didn't rest sufficiently.

Another is that I had basic psychological needs that were suddenly not being met. Given that I had identified strongly with the UW mission and was deemed not to be a good fit, my self-efficacy and my general belief that working hard leads to a good life took a hit.

As I see life right now, there's probably at least some truth to both.
