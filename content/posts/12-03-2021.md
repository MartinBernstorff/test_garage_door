I think, gradually, [[Value curiosity]] and [[Value caring]] are starting to collide.

I have a gradually harder time seeing a long-term future with Mieke, as [[Mieke isn't curious]], and that makes it hard for us to have conversations I find interesting.

[[Mieke desires common, slow paced routines]], and that is starting to add some friction as well. I desire them too, but not to the same extent and probably not as routines. I want them as conscious choices.

It especially adds friction as free time decreases, because it isn't terribly important to me.
