# Auto-schedulers don't care about variety
Probably moderated through [[Sequence matters when a task drains a resource on a temporary basis]].

From a focus and enjoyment point of view, doing the same or highly similar tasks for a long time in a row is likely to decrase focus, whereas variety increases it. However, not all auto-schedulers allows for this to be taken into account.

There are some easy workarounds. You can check whether today's tasks are urgent and, if not, check the next week for more interesting tasks.

In principle, you can also use timemaps from SkedPal, but this does increase complexity of scheduling quite a lot.
