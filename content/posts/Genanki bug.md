# Genanki bug
[[$My Personal Mnemonic Medium (instance)]] may be issuing duplicate note IDs and card IDs, but I don't think it causes issues because the GUIDs are the same. The only problem is that the note history is bodged, but that doesn't matter much.

How do I test this? #p4    #life/project/1. rare#
