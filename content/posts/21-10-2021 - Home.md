*How am I feeling?*
Spending time with Pernille was extremely  pleasant yesterday! It seems  that she is sensitive and highly thoughtful about relationships and sex, so I need to take very good care of her. 

Part of that is figuring out [[§My Vision of My Partner]], and specifically, how Pernille fits into that. Also:
* [[§My Vision of My Partnership]]
	* [[§My Vision of Myself as a Partner]]
	* [[§My Vision of My Partner]]

I'd regret not knowing that, and then letting her get hurt. 

I prefer to have an appointment in the calendar with her; it makes me feel safe and ensures we'll meet up, that I can kick it out of my mind. 

Other than that, nothing much taking up mental space! Looking forward to spending time with Mads and Simon. In the next couple of days, I want to pursue more knowledge of the above.
