# Which role does LinkedIn play
It’s basically about whether it’ll help me realise [[§My Vision for Work]].

* [[LinkedIn maintains professional connections]]

I see LinkedIn as a way of competing for attention, but also as an easy way of getting my name known and recognised in social circles where I typically don’t take time or space (i.e. Data Science). Showing up and being active in those environments, if I can do so in a way that contributes and adds value, is likely to be useful.
