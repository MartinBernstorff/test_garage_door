Q. What is an example from medical school where interleaved practice might be useful?

Q. What is an example from epidemiology where interleaved practice might be useful?

Q. Why is interleaved practice useful?
A. It allows identification of the dissimilarities in similar problems

Q. Which errors does interleaved practice help with?
A. Misidentification

Q. Why might it be problematic to go straight to interleaved practice, without initial blocked practice?
A. We need to know the defining similarities of a problem type, before we can discriminate between them.

Initial practice is required to learn solutions to simple problems first, then you increase difficulty.
