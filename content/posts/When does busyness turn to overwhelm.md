# When does busyness turn to overwhelm
Busyness is both the mark of the extremely productive, thriving person and the harried, burnt-out millennial. What separates them?

* Choice and autonomy

* Meaning and storytelling

* Type of self-care
	* Exercise, contribution, focused reading and loving relationships vs.
	* Couch-potato, drinking to numb pain, escapism, gaming, scattering one’s mind on multiple sources of media

Furthermore, if we imagine that we just need a better system, we might run into the [[§Efficiency Paradox]].
