# Do I want to have separate notes on defining the problem,  shaping the strategy and implementation?
I find that considering many different types of work at once can make it much harder to make progress on any of them. This may be since having the solution at hand makes it easy to focus, or it may be that focusing makes it easy to find the solution.

If I separate into problem statement and strategy:
* I make it easier exactly what type of problem I’m trying to solve at a given time. 
* It also makes it easier to refactor that notes. 

That is not a bad idea. It does add some overhead in marking the notes (probably in the title, to make linking easier) – but that overhead may be a metacognitive benefit.
