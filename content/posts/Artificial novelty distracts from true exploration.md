# Artificial novelty distracts from true exploration
When we want to build something great, we often don't know what that is or how to get there. Then we can't do objective based search, we must do [[§Novelty search]]. However, it is severely hampered by [[Artificial novelty]], eg. news.

If our sense for novelty is satisfied by constant [[Artificial novelty]], we'll never encounter new information (in the sense of improving our understanding of the world), and given that [[Building requires feedback]], we'll never improve.

This is most likely mediated through [[The Dopamine Hypothesis]].

## Backlinks
* [[§Novelty search]]
	* It works because, traiditionally, [[Novelty is a signal of information]]. However, in modern life, [[Artificial novelty distracts from true exploration]].
* [[Keeping media salient without inboxes]]
	* The general idea is to avoid [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], but also spending too much time collecting media ([[Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is]]) and/or browsing media that has high novelty but makes little difference in your life ([[Artificial novelty distracts from true exploration]]).
