However, it obviously isn't true – it's a bunch of positive feedback loops that would self-reinforce into either mania or depression in everyone. 

In reality, there are dampeners on this loop:
* [[Principper for endokrinologisk funktionsundersøgelse]] – as stimuli increase, response to a given stimulus decreases

* Since [[MIL balances stimulation and relaxation]], there’s probably some detail there as well.

And, if it leads [[Fast positive but delayed negative feedback fosters compulsion]]:
* Over-induling in a given stimulus, leading to both:
	* Less variation
	* Greater habituation

If we can avoid these effects, it would appear that we can keep the positive feedback loop going most of the time! I've probably missed something, but I'm not sure what.
