# ?Plan spanning multiple time horizons
*Prioritising*
Strategic choices as much about what not to do, as they are about what to do.

This means that they are about prioritising ([[Use heuristics for prioritisation]]). Prioritising inherently requires that we have options to compare, and that these options have similar dimensions.

This leads us to planning at different time horizons. They allow us to compare options at similar timescales, so that we can simulate and compare their predicted outcomes. 

*Generating options*
When we think at the time scale of years, our ambitions are different. Our sense of risk is different. And we are more cognizant of what truly matters.

Momentary, day to day friction and regret is inevitable. They can be reduced, they matter, but mostly in the perspective of how they affect your life trajectory. Thinking at these different timescales helps us remember this. I'm keeping each time scale salient, we remember the meaning and importance of even our daily and weekly plans.

[[Try out Gingkoapp for planning multiple time horizons]] - didn’t go terribly well. Instead I might try having the same time horizons, but in Bear app? I can try it with adding links to each daily note to the corresponding time horizons – or do it with intervals? The important thing is that [[Human-friendly systems allow for forgetting]].
