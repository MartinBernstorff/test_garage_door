# Pitch 2: Symptoms as markers of some latent traits
*The problem*
Self-reported symptoms in clinical practice are much different than the  symptom-reporting in the general population. Traditionally, some symptoms have in clinical practice been perceived as “somatic”, whereas others have been perceived as “mental”.

However, little is known as to whether symptoms in the general population are associated to the same outcomes as they are when they’re in clinical practice. 

Since only a subset of symptom reporters reach clinical practice, one might imagine that symptoms in the general population are a mixture of intensities, ie. equal to those reported in clinical practice but including   lower-intensities. However, they might also be entirely different.

To elucidate whether non-specific health complaints in the general population is best considered as individual symptoms, one or two dimensions, we examine the association between a range of self-reported symptoms and prospective number of new diagnoses stratified  by hospital department type (somatic or psychiatric).
