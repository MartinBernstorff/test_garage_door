# Daily batch of emails
Can I send all unread emails to a separate, mobile-inbox once or twice a day? 

This allows me to be sure not to miss anything, while also minimizing the amount of mobile phone checking. This is essentially a version of [[Impact Density Scheduling]]. 

We might even use importance to circumvent the regular schedule, allowing for email delivery every 2 hours or so.
