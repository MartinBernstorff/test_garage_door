- [[How far away from  ction time do outcomes occur]] – hvad er det konkret jeg vil plotte?
	- Plot distance from visit to event, to see how to catch as many events as possible
		- Find all visits
		- Keep only visits belonging to a person with event
		- Add event time to merge
		- Calculate distance
			* Only keep a visit if it's at least 3 months after the previous visit
			* Lag/lead? But then it only compares with previous visit, doesn't take into account if that visit was removed from the list
	* Plot afstand fra besøg indtil censur – men det kan jeg udregne bare som datoforskelle
