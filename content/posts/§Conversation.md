Conversations are like a dance; they are improvisational, you need to dance /with/ your partner to get a good conversation.

*What makes someone a good conversationalist?*
Part of that is being honest, open-minded, kind, humble and creative. To allow room to express thoughts and emotions, and to care about doing that with someone ([[Part of enjoying conversations is feeling the emotions of the other]]). 

* Handling ideas
	* [[New-born ideas are fragile]]
	* [[Newborn ideas are a challenge to your imagination, not your critical thinking]]
		* [[The promise of adolescent work can be estimated from its rate of improvement]]
	* [[Criticising newborn ideas can seem clever]]

* [[§Kindness]]
	* [[Kindness fosters interestingness]]´

I think many of the qualities of Andy Matuschak might help with that.
