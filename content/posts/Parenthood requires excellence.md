# Parenthood requires excellence
I have the sense that if I'm going to be a parent, I want to do it well. Essentially, I don't want to do most things if I don't do them well.

This may have a tinge of perfectionism. Sometimes more things, done less well, is the optimum.

But  I don't believe that's fair to a child. If I, personally, am going to be a parent, I want to do it really well.
