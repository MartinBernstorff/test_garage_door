# How hard should I work?
As an alternate approach, I want to live by [[§Nobility]] and [[Enjoyable usefulness]]. As such, I should work as hard as is meaningful; seek to rise so that I can serve others.

[[When am I working hard enough?]]

## Signs
I don’t know what to do when:
* I can take time off (I could use that time to polish my work further, or to develop new projects)

* I don't know whether to take a long break in the middle of the day

* I don't know if I'm working hard enough



[[Avoid laziness]]
