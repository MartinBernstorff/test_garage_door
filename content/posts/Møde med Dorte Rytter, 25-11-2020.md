# Møde med Dorte Rytter, 25/11/2020
* Open problems
	* Endometriosis
		* Can we do better surgery via machine learning
		* Can we identify early risk factors/causes via BSIG?
	* Complications for COVID vaccine
		* Collect non-specific vaccine information before and after
		* Combine with app and/or genetics information, primarily to improve odds of funding
			* Funding round incoming from NOVO
		* Which vaccine do we get in DK
		* Complication rate is the primary end-point, but also to “insure” against risk of complications
		* Which vaccines should other countries get
		* Problems could be how to gather funding, collecting data and whether seasonal changes could bias the results (eg. If we’re comparing not-yet-vaccinated in February with vaccinated in June).
	* Thoughts on their impact
* Research environment
	* What’s next to learn for me?
