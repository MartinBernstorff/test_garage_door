# Slack is required for improvement
If we’re to improve on something, it means that we have to sit down and analyse the situation and typically also accept a period of lower performance. We can’t do that if we don’t have slack.

Q. How does low slack affect the performance of a system in the long run?
A. It decreases the rate of improvement, so it decreases long term performance.

* [[WIP decreases flexibility]]
	* Since more WIP means more people waiting for you to get something done, you’re more often the bottleneck and that means you have more things that “have” to get done. [[WIP decreases slack]], but [[Slack is required for improvement]].
