# §Playfulness
Playfulness allows us to have fun, to explore with greater width ([[§Novelty search]], wider distributions of outcomes), and probably to get more things done! 

> Don’t worry about doing it “right,” don’t worry about “how long it’s taking me,” don’t worry about “solving” the problem or doing something “important.” Just enjoy the interaction with the problem and the impulses you feel relative to it. Act on those impulses; watch what happens; act on the new impulses. Turn up the temperature on the distribution.
