# Betting table for research
For the technicalities: [[§Technology for the betting table]].

The purpose is to [[Select the right problems]]. This is best done by incorporating the best available information, which happens best with collaborators. It is also easier if there are multiple problems to choose from, so the question isn’t “is this opportunity good enough”, it’s “which opportunity do we want to work on next”.

I imagine a small set of [[§Writing a research idea pitch]], where everyone has read through them and selected the ideas they find most promising. 

Ideally on the parameters that make the idea publishable, as well as the parameters that make it useful.

*Useful*
* [[Valuable research changes our model of the world]]
* [[Valuable research uncovers levers for change]]

*Publishable*
* Novelty 
* Interestingness

<!-- #research Which parameters determine rejection/acceptance? See slides from How to Get Published, as well as the description in Pediatrics for authors.    -->

We’ll then meet and discuss them, argue for which things we think work best, and make decisions.

* [[Prototyping for research ideas]]
	* Since one of the answers to [[Why do we prototype?]] is to be able to cover more ground, we also need a way of sharing and evaluating the pitches to select what to do, see [[Betting table for research]].
* [[$My research production process]]
	* The process consists of multiple phases: [[Shape research ideas]], [[Betting table for research]], [[Produce research papers]] and [[Disseminate research knowledge]]. The justification for each phase is in each link.

	* Q. What are the 4 major parts in your research production process?
