Quite interested in the idea of a [[Â§Today Stack]], where items are automatically sorted by recency. Then the stack becomes not only an archive, but also a cache of what I find most important. 

The daily notes turn into a reflection space for general considerations, which then branches out into the stack-notes instead. It somewhat limits me in that doing the planning/reflection is high friction with the current iPad because of the delay on tap. If I stick to this, and it continues to be helpful, I can always switch, though.
