# How do I select new projects
The question becomes about [[Prioritization]] while avoiding [[Analysis paralysis]].

Furthermore, some projects require specific assumptions to be examined. Often this can be done empirically, which means that I have to do research.

When doing that, to avoid feeling confused and to get the most bang for your buck, either [[Ask specific questions before starting research]] or [[Make specific predictions before starting research]].
