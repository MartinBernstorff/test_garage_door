## Backlinks
* [[Emotions are intuition that something is important]]
	* How, then, do we determine whether the emotions are valid? [[§Intuition]] can be validated by [[§Deliberation]] ([[Deliberate about models]]), so [[§Emotions]] can probably be validated by [[§Deliberation]] ([[Deliberate to validate emotions]]).
* [[How do we develop causal understanding]]
	* Much of it arises through [[§Intuition]], but for some areas, intuition is dramatically insufficient.
* [[Insight requires patience]]
	* To allow our [[§Intuition]] to work on a problem, we need to be patient. To allow ourselves to absorb the problem, and wait for a solution.
* [[Practice like a scientist, perform like an artist]]
	* Evidence can inform intuition, allowing us to get the best from empirical measurements while getting the pleasant [[Flow]] experience of [[Use heuristics]] and [[§Intuition]] ([[Intuition is emergent heuristics]]).
