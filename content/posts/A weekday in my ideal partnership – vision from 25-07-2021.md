# A weekday in my ideal partnership – vision from 25/07/2021
We wake up together in near-total darkness after a long night's sleep. No alarm clock unless it's necessary.

We kiss each other good morning, and press the button that starts the morning routine. We embrace each other as we hear the coffee machine start brewing, we feel the warmth of the sun as the blinds separate, and the lights start to fade in. 

I go for a 5-10 minute shower, and she joins me when she wants to; but we always know that the shower is to be short, and we're just there to relax for a bit.

We then sit down to meditate, to get calm and clarity; for 5 minutes or 30 minutes, whatever we need, and we're free to get up separately or together.

We then set down to eat breakfast, which is typically a quiet affair. We plan our days, and sync up about any difficulties we might see coming up or points where we might be able to help each other.

We then head off to work separately, which we enjoy.

```
The evening block can be separated into different themes, and we try to vary them between:
1. Making arrangements separately (typically with friends)
2. Dinner with mutual friends
3. Individual activities
```

If we don't have arrangements with friends, we arrive back home at 17-17:30, and do minor activities separately, like repeating flashcards, tidying up, listening to music, reading a bit.

Then at around 18:00, we start to prepare dinner – as we're cooking, we talk about the day.

As we're washing up, we talk about how we want to spend the evening. We're both a bit introverted, so there's a range of activities that we pick from and which we do together or apart, depending on the day: reading, gaming with friends, taking a walk etc. 

Then at around 21, we lay together in bed and feel out how we want to spend the evening – sex or reading.
