# Caring emotionally might be necessary
* [[Feelings are necessary for true values]]
* [[Feelings are necessary for true relationships]]
* [[Feelings are necessary for continuously applying effort]]

This implies that it is paramount to [[Align emotions and cognitions]]. 

On a surface level, this has tension with [[§ACT]]. ACT argues that that [[Emotions are volatile]], at least in the moment, so they aren’t terribly helpful. However, taking action, and especially [[§Effort]] is much easier to apply if you feel like it’s the right thing to do. 

Furthermore, volatility ≠ low validity. Noise doesn't mean there isn't signal. I think [[§ACT]] would agree that, when emotions are consistent, and we can't cognitively disprove what they're saying (ie. we don't expect bias), then they're worth listening to. [[Emotions are messengers]].
