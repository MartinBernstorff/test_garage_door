# Rebound failure modes
Rebound relationships can cause pain, and in popular culture they typically do.

## Direct pain in the relationship
Hurting others because you're not ready to give them an honest chance. This might look and feel like using them to avoid loneliness, rather than engaging with them as human beings.

Hurting yourself because you still feel like you have to be faithful to your ex.

Or, the reverse, committing to a relationship to make your ex jealous.

## Suboptimal decisions for long-term thriving
Committing to a relationship too early to avoid loneliness (rather than because you think you’re a good fit with the partner).

This makes you avoid taking sufficient time to figure out what you want, or being erroneously confident in what you want.
