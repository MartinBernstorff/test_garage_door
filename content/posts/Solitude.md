# Solitude
[[May I prefer solitude because my immediate social environment doesn't suit me?]]

The reason I want this may be:

* [[Â§Relaxation]]
It allows me to be less self-conscious and to just do whatever I want, without concern for others.

* [[Autonomy (SDT)]]
See above.

* [[Competence (SDT)]]
Allows me to be creative and to work on something difficult, without distraction. Also allows me to be completely creative, to think about whatever I want.

*So, how do we make time for that?* 
* Incremental thinking with headphones
* Making use of the time Mieke isn't at home for reading/thinking

If it's mostly about getting time for relaxing:
* Going for a run
* Working out
