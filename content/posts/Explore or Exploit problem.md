# Explore or Exploit problem
A problem type where you must decide between an uncertain option or a more certain option. Requires that you can choose the same option more than once, and that you gain information from each trial

Whether to explore or exploit depends in large part on how much time (how many trials) you have on your hands. Exploration is highly valuable if you have much time to exploit, whereas exploitation is highly valuable if you're short on time (eg. finding a favourite restaurant the last night of a vacation isn't terribly helpful).

In general, we tend to over-explore (eg. over-discount the future), especially if the "succes" rates are constant, which tends to be the case in our world ("A Coke is a Coke").

Is opposite of the [[Optimal stopping]] problem, where we tend to under-explore.

The best strategy is to keep staying on a winner, but to switch as losses start to rack up. Stay harder the more wins you've accumulated.

For an exact solution, look at the [[Gittins index]].
For a simpler solution, use the [[Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm]]

When can you outsource or make exploration more effective, so that you can exploit?

Many situations in life are really both exploration and exploitation, eg. dates are about finding a partner, but can also be fun in themselves.

	* Most of my reading goes through a funnel; but the thing is, I’m the person taking care of every step of that funnel. This means that time spent at the top of the funnel is time I cannot spend reading. It’s an [[Explore or Exploit problem]] - one where I'm still uncertain about when to commit. For now, using my gut is yielding pretty good results, so let's stick with that!
* [[Keeping media salient without inboxes]]
	* Since we're continually adding more articles, past articles will take up a gradually larger portion of the suggested articles. This isn't necessarily a problem; it biases towards "exploitation" of known information rather than exploration of new information, which makes sense since my reading interval is decreasing (for more, see [[Explore or Exploit problem]]). However, we may counteract some of the effect by showing recently added articles more often ([[Bias towards recency]]).
* [[Prioritise reading over meandering when the material is good]]
	* Browsing/exploring media can be seen as an [[Explore or Exploit problem]]. We are choosing between a) selecting an item from the reading list or b) going to the internet to find material.

	* I think I could still be happy if we had a child, but I think I could be even happier if I found someone like Mieke, who didn't want children. We may be too young to compromise on this, too large an [[Explore or Exploit problem]] interval left to commit.
