[[Keeping media salient without inboxes]]

Roughly schedule time. I mean roughly in more than one dimension; keep the date flexible, the duration flexible, and the content flexible. Something like "for 1 hour every week, consume something readable" and then have a reading inbox to select from. You can then [[Decrease options to make decision-making easier]] to limit time spent browsing.

This is a form of [[Inbox-alternative]].

Where else will I organically stumble upon them?

This can also be used to keep ideas on what to do with Mieke salient.

This is a type of [[Programmable attention]]

For ideas, I have a decent system going in Obsidian ([[$My thinking system]]).
