I’m feeling great today! Getting out of my home address is… So liberating!

I’ve got a few new ideas for today:

* [[Implementation: Stack of Possibilities]]
	* Use the `#p` stack for this. Allows for things of different types to be added.
		* Is this somewhat like a multi-level scheduler? 
	* Problems with [[Systems should be self cleaning]]
		* Having multiple buckets implies that there is meaning to where each item is in the list
		* But this information decays, and I do *not* want to have to maintain it. A better metric is recency, so just flagging it all on one dimension is probably pretty good!
	* Might run into problems with [[Balance context switching]], depending on the size of each item
		* If too atomised, will have to change what’s in memory often

* [[Vestervang 34: Hvad vil jeg gøre ved tapet-endevæggen?]]

- Vaske tøj

- Cykeltur

* [[Prep for delivering packages]]
