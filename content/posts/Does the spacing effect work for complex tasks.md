# Does the spacing effect work for complex tasks
> In one meta-analysis by Donovan and Radosevich (1999), for instance, the size of the spacing effect declined sharply as conceptual difficulty of the task increased from low (e.g. rotary pursuit) to average (e.g. word list recall) to high (e.g. puzzle). By this finding, the benefits of spaced practise may be muted for many mathematics tasks.
But there are many positive results as well, including introductory statistics.
