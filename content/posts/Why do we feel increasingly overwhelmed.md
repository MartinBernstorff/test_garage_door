# Why do we feel increasingly overwhelmed
[[§Busyness]]

Probably because we are more buffered? Lack of business comes from time that isn't occupied - if you're constantly buffered, you're constantly occupied. One solution is to set a higher [[Threshold for Commitment]].

Another argument is that business is an indicator of thriving. If you're motivated by something important, you'll inherently become busy. If you go too far, it'll turn into [[Overwhelm]].

However, business may have become the goal in some cases, instead of a necessary indicator. 

This if further emphasised if we ignore the [[Theory of Constraints]], and assume that not filling our time is by definition a waste.

We also constantly have alternative activities available, especially given our smartphones and computers that are constantly around us.

The bar for doing “enough” has never been more elusive, because there is an infinite amount of things that can be desirable, and we’re constantly bombarded with images of people that have achieved those things. Unfortunately, our view of them is extremely biased - we see the top 1%, and we only see them in the arena where they’re the most proficient.

Important to remember that busyness isn't terrible in itself - it's [[Overwhelm]] we want to avoid.

Q. What feedback structures encourage busyness?
A. Busyness gives short term positive feedback, but only negative feedback in the long term.
