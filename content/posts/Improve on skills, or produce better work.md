# Improve on skills, or produce better work
Since both the meta-skill of [[§Scientific Productivity]] and the act of producing are highly valuable, which to devote time to largely depends on the opportunity costs. I have tremendous amounts of continuous time, as well as highly skilled co-authors to work with – so the opportunity cost of not making use of that interaction is high. It favors doing work within FSS, so looking for interesting problems and working on them with rigour is a great choice right now.

Q. What does it make the most sense to do at work right now?
A. Produce as much as possible within FSS. I have the ability, time and co-authors to do it. And it allows me to [[Signal competence]] in the future.

This is the primary question for me right now. It determines whether I'll be better off spending my Obsidian time working on various tasks, or whether it's better spent considering how to edge towards a good #service:

The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. We want to produce great work, and the act of production incites the need and excitement for learning new methods.

But there are also types of work that we can't conceive of unless we have the mental methods of the right methods. This ties into [[$Make time for exploration]].
