# Percentile feedback makes my belly burn and disrupts my sleep
At least for the first week I use it. What does this tell me?

This may be due to my stance, that I see it as a “how well have I been doing”, ie. evaluative and ego-involvement. Instead, it may be possible to make more of a playful stance, allowing it to become more enjoyable.

Or I may just have to listen to my gut.
