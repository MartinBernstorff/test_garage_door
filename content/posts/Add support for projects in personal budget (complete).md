# Add support for projects in personal budget (complete)

[[§My personal finances]]

The problem is that my current projections don't factor in projects. This means that I misrepresent my true consumption, and thus forecast wrong. That's because the project substitutes the category.

#### Strategy
As a proposed solution, 
+ I can add a separate column called "project" 
+ which filters in to another sheet of projects.
+ Add validation to the project column
+ Those project sums are then filtered into the projection tab.
+ And as cleanup, I'll also have to migrate the posts that I have already categorised 
+ and remove the projects from the M tab

One problem I'm running into is how to categorise it in M. Most of the expenses don't fit neatly into some category – rather, they fit into a "vacation" or "oplevelse" category. This is probably a better fit.
