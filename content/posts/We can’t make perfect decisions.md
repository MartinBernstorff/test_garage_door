# We can’t make perfect decisions
We have imperfect information, we don’t properly understand all causal networks and we have limited time to make our decisions. This is why we need to [[Use heuristics]].

## Backlinks
* [[§Commitment]]
	* When and for how long to commit depends largely on our best guess at the current causal model ([[Establish a causal model]]) and available alternatives. However, since [[We can’t make perfect decisions]], we need to [[Use heuristics for prioritisation]].
