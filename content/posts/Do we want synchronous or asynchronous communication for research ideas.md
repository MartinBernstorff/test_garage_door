# Do we want synchronous or asynchronous communication for research ideas?
This leans against [[Project management for research]], and is an essential part of [[§Technology for the betting table]].

Research ideas aren’t something that are done or not done, and they typically require quite a bit of back and forth – ie.
* They can’t be solved in just one meeting
	* There may be a need for research in between
* Delays due to waiting time for meetings will be high
* People are less likely to be critical verbally

This all favours asynchronous communication.

In favour of synchronous communication is:
* [[Balance WIP]], you don’t have the half-finished always-on sense you get from notifications
* All the extra context you get from communicating directly with a person
* A “forcing function” for feedback, since it needs to be ready by XY.

However, it’ll probably delay the process quite a bit, or participants get tired and hurry it along so we don’t examine the ideas well enough.
