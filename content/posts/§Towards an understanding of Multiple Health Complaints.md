# §Towards an understanding of Multiple Health Complaints
The most interesting questions, I think, are:

[[§Article-idea 3]]

#### What do children with MHC perceive
[[Which symptoms are most prevalent among children with MHC]]
[[Which groupings exist within MHC]]

#### What are the causes of those perceptions
Which causes do doctors expect: [[Which diagnoses do children with MHC receive]]

Or may there be a common cause: [[Is MHC associated with outcomes in ways that are not face valid]]

[[Is the somatic dimension of the HBSC-SCL predictive of psychiatric endpoints and vice-versa]]

[[Is MHC (conditional on the relevant symptoms symptoms) associated with endpoints we wouldn't predict]]

#### Are we treating children with MHC appropriately
[[Is MHC as a concept associated with more z-diagnoses and r-diagnoses]]

[[Is MHC separate from known diseases]]

[[Is the MHC flow in hospital generally appropriate]]
