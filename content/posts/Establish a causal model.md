# Establish a causal model
A good starting point is asking "why" five times, to approach the root cause.

It is almost always a good idea to first [[Do your own thinking]], and if afterwards it is indicated, to research what others believe ([[Balance researching and thinking for causal models]], [[Collaboration speeds up problem solving]]).

* [[Define the problem]]
	* What does this mean? Firstly, it means [[Identify the signs]] that something is problematic. Then it means to [[Establish a causal model]] of why that is, to identify which levers you can push.
* [[§Commitment]]
	* When and for how long to commit depends largely on our best guess at the current causal model ([[Establish a causal model]]) and available alternatives. However, since [[We can’t make perfect decisions]], we need to [[Use heuristics for prioritisation]].
