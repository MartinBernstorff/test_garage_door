# Weekly review
For now, I just want something *super simple* that I can do with [[$My Implementation of Life Well Spent (LWS)]]. 

I want it to fulfil basic functions:

+ Baseline reflection
	* What matters to you?
	* How does that fit with where your time went?

+ Grant me an overview of my values, so I can consider 
	1. How well I'm acting by them
	2. Whether I'm missing something
	3. Whether something is no longer current
+ Grant me an overview of where my time went
+ [[Do I want to review work and leisure together]]
	+ Grant me an overview of my goals, for the same function

How do I do this technically, then? For goals and values, simply having a list that allows text input is probably enough.

For the baseline reflection, I can just add a "baseline reflection" "value".
