Q. Why does decreased multitasking lead to increased efficiency?
A. It decreases lag time and it decreases context switching.

* [[Decrease lag time]]
	* How, then, do we decrease lag time? Some of the answer is probably in [[Optimise the critical chain]], much of it is in [[Minimise multitasking]]
* [[?First things first]]
	* Fits poorly with [[Balance WIP]], in that it makes it hard to [[Minimise multitasking]]. At least at the level of days – you could decide to spend whole days on the part of your life that are most important to you. This’ll increase [[§Staleness (productivity)]] and obligation, though :-(
