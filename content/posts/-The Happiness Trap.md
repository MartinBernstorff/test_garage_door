# $The Happiness Trap
A book on [[§ACT]].

When we say happiness, what we really mean are two different things:
1. Positive affect
2. Life satisfaction

[[ACT is about how to optimise life satisfaction through taking action]]. It's best to [[Focus on your actions]],  because [[Your actions are all you control]].

It argues that [[Chasing positive affect leads to suffering]] and [[Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering]].

We're stuck in the happiness trap because we don't acknowledge that [[It is normal to experience discomfort]]. Since [[We're expected to control our inner world]], [[People pretend to be happy]] and this makes your eventual unhappiness seem abnormal, making you even more unhappy! Worse even, [[A meaningful life contains discomfort]] so that [[Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering]].

I do that too, see [[My examples of thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems]].

While we can control the outer world relatively well (/fix the roof if the water is dripping on you, work more hours to get better pay, [[We largely control what we do]]/), [[We have limited control over what we think]] and [[We have limited control over what we feel]]. The extent to which you believe this can be scored with the [[Control of Thoughts and Feelings Questionnaire]].

However, our default is to experience [[Cognitive fusion]]. [[Thoughts are important if they're helpful]], and for those, cognitive fusion is awesome! But [[Defuse from your thoughts when they become unhelpful]].

The same goes for emotions! First of all, [[Thoughts about emotions can cause problems]] in the same way that regular thoughts can. [[Emotions are important if they're helpful]], and [[Make room for your feelings when they become unhelpful]].

As you start to be liberated from your unhelpful thoughts and feelings, it's time to [[§Clarify your values to know which actions to take]].

Many times in our life, we're preoccupied by thoughts and this causes us to miss out on what's happening in the moment. [[Connect with the present moment]].  This is the solution if you're already doing all the things that matter to you, but are deeply unfulfilled.

After that, we need to figure out how to [[Take action on your values to live a meaningful life]]. Remember that [[Humans don't naturally act in accordance with their values]], so the fact that you're not already acting tells you nothing about whether the value is important to you. [[Succes in life means living by your values]].
