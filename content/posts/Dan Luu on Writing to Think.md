# Dan Luu on Writing to Think
https://mobile.twitter.com/danluu/status/1453454530444619778

[[Writing forces sharper understanding]], Dan Luu argues you should work on sharpening your thinking rather than slowing down to the speed of writing.
	This seems true, but doesn’t consider lack of short term memory, nor the effort required to encode an argument into long term memory ([[§Personal Mnemonic Medium]]). Nor does it allow knowledge work to accrete.

One of his arguments is that we need to linearise thoughts – this applies much less to a personal knowledge system.
