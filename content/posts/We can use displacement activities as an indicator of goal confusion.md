# We can use displacement activities as an indicator of goal confusion
We can use displacement activities as an indicator that we don't know which motivations to pursue, and that we should enter a reflective state to find out.

Q. You notice you're doing a displacement activity. What now?
A. Stop and reflect, either at the level of a) Values or b) Goals. Consider [[The Motivation Equation]].

We might also make it harder to do highly engaging displacement activities ([[Modern life has made displacement activities too attractive]], [[Burn the ships to decrease distraction]]).
