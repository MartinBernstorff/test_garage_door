# What determines how often we want to see a prompt

* [[Could the buttons on spaced repetition reflect whether we want to get better at a given prompt]]
	* A bigger question is, [[What determines how often we want to see a prompt]]?
* [[Mike Anki make it harder for us to do relevance realisation]]
	* And, by extension, make us less intelligent? Maybe, as a counter, we might ask [[What determines how often we want to see a prompt]], and then reframe the buttons to be 'more or less frequent', allowing our [[Relevance Realisation]] to guide prompt frequency.

This differs a lot! Prompts help retention. They outperform regular memory when the environment doesn’t facilitate those facts, even though they’re valuable.

In that sense, prompts allow system 2 to affect memory. If we can [[§Forecasting]] accurately what we need to know or what we want to be, we can use prompts to shape us to fit that world. 

A prompt, then, is relevant if it helps us become the person we’d like to be, to engage more deeply with the world.

Can we shape the feedback to the scheduler to reflect this?

Also, it helps us learn things just for fun!

Hints at one dimension: Relevance.

Another is more mechanical, whether we have integrated the prompt sufficiently. I think we’ll have decent intuition on this as well. 

These two dimensions can be reduced to simpler buttons, “more” or “less”!

Is it aligned with who we want to become?

Have we already learned what there is to learn?

Can we remember what it said?
