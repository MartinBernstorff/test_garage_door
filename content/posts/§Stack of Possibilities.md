# §Stack of Possibilities
I don’t want to write down projects in a way that make them feel like obligations. I merely want to make it easy to maintain salience and, when I have time to spare, to easily get a list of options to choose (or not!) from.

This implies something like a [[§Stack]], where items can decay ([[Systems should be self cleaning]], [[Stacks promote agency]]), but are promoted the more I engage with them. 

This organic decay might even outcompete monthly or whatever tags. It also further supports [[Building requires repeated attention]], without feeling forced.

Also makes for fewer borders, and more room for task-switching to something I’ve considered doing before. It’s very much like the [[§Stack of Possibilities]], where what I probably need to modify is [[Terminology for Service and Leisure]].

* [[§Today Stack]]
	* A riff on the [[§Stack of Possibilities]], but I’m unsure exactly which benefits focusing on the day specifically affords me.
* [[Can I use my level of certainty to rank notes]]
	* This marries [[Peripheral vision (design)]] with a [[§Stack of Possibilities]]. The problem I’m trying to solve is combining different types of notes.
	* Another question is, why am I not more drawn to examining the [[§Stack of Possibilities]]? Typically, when I do so, I’m delighted at what I find!
