# Nudge towards awareness of time for intra-project decisions
Eg. some behaviours are best for start of project (eg. explore), some for end (eg. finishing/exploiting). 

However, we have to be aware of the remaining amount of time for us to make informed decisions on this. I want to build something that allows me to do this.

Unexpected, or detrimental consequences of this are going to be something like:

* More stress 
* Less enjoyment
* Higher focus on smaller tasks due to bounded nature of time

But I expect some positive consequences as well:
* Higher productivity due to a sense of urgency
* Better prioritisation, ie. dropping unimportant tasks
* Better decision-making due to approximate prediction of workload (fewer errors due to forgetting something)
