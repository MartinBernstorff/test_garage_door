# Weight of PhD depends on specialty
In the sense that it helps me get a HU-stilling more if it's in the specialty of the HU-stilling.

[[Jens Christian Tofteby Knudsen]] reports that a PhD will be beneficial, regardless of the specialty. But that a specialty-specific PhD is even more beneficial. However, this is probably of relatively low weight compared to the amount and duration of research youâ€™ve been doing.

I don't have much concrete knowledge on this, so I'll have to ask around.

	* Right now, I believe that I'll want to do a PhD in something. But what that something is depends on {which specialty I want to go into ([[Weight of PhD depends on specialty]])}.
