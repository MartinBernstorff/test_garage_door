# Deliberate about models

## Backlinks
* [[Use heuristics]]
	* Heuristics can be developed both unconsciously ([[Intuition is emergent heuristics]]) and consciously ([[Deliberate about models]], [[All models are heuristics]]).
* [[§Intuition]]
	* [[Deliberate about models]]
* [[Emotions are intuition that something is important]]
	* How, then, do we determine whether the emotions are valid? [[§Intuition]] can be validated by [[§Deliberation]] ([[Deliberate about models]]), so [[§Emotions]] can probably be validated by [[§Deliberation]] ([[Deliberate to validate emotions]]).
* [[§Emotions]]
	* Our stated values, then, are our model of our true values ([[All models are heuristics]], [[Deliberate about models]]).
