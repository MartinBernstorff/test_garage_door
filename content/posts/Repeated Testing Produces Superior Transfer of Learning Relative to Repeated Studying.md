*Does this imply that memorising the concepts might be sufficient, or is at least not as bad as I had feared?* 

Probably not as bad, but does not disprove it very hard:
> In the present study, there were no memory demands with respect to the recognition component because subjects were explicitly told that the questions on the final test were related to the information they had learned in the previous session.

When I can't come up with a specific phrasing that cues the information in the same way as a real world situation would, just learning the concepts might be enough.

Factors that enhance [[§Knowledge transfer]]:
* Encoding specificity principle: Retrieval cues affect retrieval to the extent that they overlap with cues in the memory trace.

* Transfer-appropriate processing: Recall probability is improved to the extent that the processes engaged during encoding match those during 
retrieval.

* Strength of initial encoding 

* Variability of encoding, e.g.:
	* Mixed results, though

Previous literature has defined transfer very narrowly; any change in the testing is consider “transfer”, e.g. going from A->B to B->A in word-pair problems.

[[Roediger 2006]] found that testing can strengthen memories of related concepts, what they call [[Retrieval Induced Facilitation (RIFA)]].

*Experiment 1a*
4 study sessions vs
1 study session, 3x same test vs
1 study session, 3 different tests

Tested again 1 week later. Conceptual and factual testing. Factual means information in one paragraph, conceptual means information spanning several paragraphs.

For rephrasing, question was reworded, answer remained the same.

* [[Retrieval prompts should discourage shallow pattern matching]]
	* I think Andy referred to a paper on Twitter where they showed that varying the prompts didn't meaningfully affect performance, indication that shallow pattern matching happens only rarely. Will have to check.
