# Cognitive load fatigues us
E.g. amount of novel information to be processed – learning how to find our way at a new place, modelling new people in social circle etc.

This seems highly likely, as I am tremendously fatigued when I start at a new hospital.

If so, 
1. [[Use heuristics]] as much as possible
2. Keep other areas of life stable
3. Increase sleep
4. Meditate, to let go of inputs that don't matter
