# Testable hypotheses for whether MHC is handled appropriately at hospital
If MHC is best handled at hospital and is handled appropriately, we expect for MHC vs. no MHC:

t = 6-24 months
IRR incident diagnoses > 2
IRR total hospital contacts proportional to incident diagnoses, when adjusting for baseline contacts

t = 24-84 months
IRR incident diagnoses ≈ 1
IRR total hospital contacts ≈ 1, when adjusting for baseline contacts

Where incident hospital contacts are hospital contacts with a new a-diagnosis. We still count the first R- and Z-diagnosis, as it may be appropriate to worry about a symptom the first time.

As you encounter the same symptom multiple times, and you've been reassured by doctors that it isn't dangerous, it is less appropriate to continously seek hospital.

We adjust for baseline contacts to eliminate the effect of already known diseases and more general ill-being on our outcome.

*Open questions*
* Do we want to set some hypotheses for medication use as well?

*Suggested results*
* Plot as a function of months from filling out the questionnaire. Probably both dot-plots and as a spline.
* Table with incident diagnoses between groups

We already know the pattern for all hospital contacts seems to not follow the above (at least on a yearly scale), but what is the pattern for new diagnoses?

## Backlinks
* [[Is the MHC flow in hospital generally appropriate]]
	* The above is a general idea, but for publication and scientific rigour it is still expected to make [[Testable hypotheses for whether MHC is handled appropriately at hospital]].
