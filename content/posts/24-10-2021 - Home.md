*How am I feeling?*
Pretty excited and motivated, actually! A little worried about quantification, probably because I have previously used it to force/ought myself to work on something where I didn’t have the desire to. The kind of work that medicine makes me do is not the kind of work that I thrive at doing, nor is It the kind of work that I’m most well-suited to do.

That doesn’t mean I can’t thrive at it! Actually working as a doctor is much more fun than studying to become a doctor.

Also new thoughts for [[Intention as context]]! I should definitely use new contexts when trying to think or program, e.g. go to Aarhus Uni on the weekends for morning contemplation.
