# Potentially higher speed
Especially when typing on the laptop, I make more mistakes. Probably due to lower tactile feedback, so when moving my hands, I'm more likely to miss-type.

I think I could type faster if I didn't have to move my hands as much as I do, and especially if I'd do fewer typos.

However, the evidence is highly inconclusive: https://www.fastcompany.com/90549172/whats-in-store-for-2021-epidemics-are-often-followed-by-social-unrest

May be due to self-selection, though.  #Life
