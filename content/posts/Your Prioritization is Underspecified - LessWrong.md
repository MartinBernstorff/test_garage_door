How can this inform [[Â§Prioritisation]]?

Risk - within-model ambiguity
Uncertainty - outside of model ambiguity

Bunch of heuristics:
* In *First-Due*prioritization we simply do whatever will have the nearest deadline.

* In *Longest-Chain*prioritization we prioritize whatever task will have the longest amount of time or largest number of sub tasks to get done.

* In *Shortest-Chain*prioritization we want to clear up the total list size as much as possible so we get all the shortest tasks done quickly.

* In *Most-Salient*prioritization we allow the vividness and emotional immediacy of tasks serve as the goad.

* In *Most-Likely-Failure*prioritization we look for tasks that have a step we are highly uncertain about and see if we can test that step, because if it fails we can maybe throw out a whole task and thus increase total throughput.

* In *Most-Reusable*prioritization we focus on those tasks whose partial or complete solutions will be most useful in the completion of multiple other tasks. This also might be thought of as a sub type of *Highest-Information-Gain*.

* In *Expected-Value*prioritization we focus on those tasks that will result in potentially the biggest payoffs, presumably creating resources for engaging with other tasks. This might sound like the best until we realize we've only pushed the problem one level up the stack as we now need to juggle the fact that there are different sorts of value payoffs and our marginal utility for a given resource and ability to convert between different sorts of value might be changing over time.

* *Expected-Loss*prioritization, with catastrophization a further sub type focusing on chance of being wiped out (often over emphasized because of the Most-Salient consideration).
