# How might I align complice or similar with ACT
Ie. Value -> Goal -> Action

One of the worries with complice is that I set goals, and that since [[Goal setting increases focus]], it can also make me more likely to miss out on something important.

To counteract that, make sure that all values are represented either as a goal or as a value.
