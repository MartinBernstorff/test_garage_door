# Writing aids thinking during memory overflow
Thinking is rapid – we quickly jump from partial conclusions to correlates of those conclusions. In doing so, we overflow working memory, losing track of the steps we have already taken. 

This is dangerous! It means we can’t inspect the reasoning, that we can lead ourselves down rabbit holes that aren’t even internally valid ([[Writing prompts sharper understanding]]).
