# Motivational intensity is increased by salience
What does salience mean? It is how real it feels when you recall it, as well as how easily you can recall it.

When implementing this, be sure to do it in a way that also increases focus on values. [[Salience of values increases autonomy]] and [[Connection between goals and values increases autonomy]].

One way of doing it is to put it in your peripheral vision – add goals to your email inbox, as well as to your iPhone as widgets.
