## Backlinks
* [[Motivational intensity is amplified by the undesirability of the alternative]]
	* Desiring to get somewhere is most strongly motivated if you allow yourself to desire getting away from where you are ([[Mental contrasting]]). Eg. desiring a vacation because it allows a break from life, but also because it will be fun in and of itself.
