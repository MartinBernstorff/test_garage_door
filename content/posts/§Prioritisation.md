# §Prioritisation
Is essentially two problems:
1. What to do at all? [[§Selection]].
2. What to do first? [[§Scheduling]], [[§Scheduling for a single agent]]

Maybe this isn’t quite right, though? [[Impact Density Scheduling]] uses the importance of a task to sort them for execution, somewhat similarly to [[§Selection]]. However, [[§Selection]] is a [[Bucket Sort]], so it might improve the overall efficiency anyway.

* [[Prioritisation should be guided by values]]
	* [[Prioritisation should be guided by goals]]

* [[Prioritisation should be minimal effort]]
	* [[Choosing requires friction]]
	* [[Use heuristics for prioritisation]]

One effective way of using [[§Prioritisation]] in a world with too much information is using algorithms; ideally trainable algorithms that take personal preference strongly into account, and that can account for distribution shift. Gmails “important” email algorithm seems to do this pretty well so far. 

Q. In your terminology, which sub-problems does [[§Prioritisation]] consist of?
A. 1. [[§Selection]], 2. [[§Scheduling]]

	* Q. In your terminology, which sub-problems does [[§Prioritisation]] consist of?
* [[§Scheduling for a single agent]]
	* This makes [[§Prioritisation]] more important than sceduling.
* [[§Planning]]
	* What separates [[Planning]] and [[§Prioritisation]]?
	* Allowing you to simulate the consequences of your actions, so you can skip the ones that aren’t important (also required for [[§Prioritisation]]).
* [[Impact Density Scheduling]]
	* The more time we spend determining something’s impact density, the higher the overhead. This means that improving [[§Prioritisation]] improves our overall lives.
* [[Focus is fundamental (coinage)]]
	* By definition, focus is acting on your [[§Prioritisation]], making it necessary for a life well-lived ([[§Focus]]). 
	* Fewer salient options means less overhead from [[§Prioritisation]].
* [[Attention is zero-sum]]
	* Since [[Attention capacity cannot be expanded]], the fact that [[Attention is zero-sum]] means that it's incredibly important to [[Protect attention]] and to do [[§Prioritisation]] well.
* [[Action menus can facilitate choice]]
	* Ties into [[§Planning]] and [[§Prioritisation]].
* [[§Rabbit Holes (attention)]]
	* One example is “Doomscrolling”. It implies a state of [[§Hyperfocus]], where we lose sense of self to the detriment of [[§Prioritisation]].
* [[§Efficiency Paradox]]
	* However, if we feel hurried and busy, the cure is rarely higher efficiency. It’s turning down opportunities and responsibilities, as well as accepting imperfection. It’s all about [[§Prioritisation]].
* [[Do I want to review work and leisure together]]
	* I think so! Part of spending time well is [[§Prioritisation]], and that requires that I can compare my options. 
* [[How do we balance goals and values]]
	* If we [[Use values to select goals]], we can live by both. It's rather a question of prioritising, of balancing values and selecting the right goals ([[§Prioritisation]]).
* [[§Executing well]]
	* [[§Prioritisation]]
* [[§Productivity]]
	* [[§Prioritisation]]
* [[Productivity is prioritisation, efficiency and time]]
	* [[§Prioritisation]]  x Efficiency x Time
	* [[§Prioritisation]] is about selecting the right objectives. This requires that we:
* [[How many hours should I work?]]
	* If you're dissatisfied with what you're getting done while under low-moderate stress, the solution isn't in more hours - it's in [[§Prioritisation]] or [[Efficiency]]. After all, [[Productivity is prioritisation, efficiency and time]].
* [[?How do we spend more time on what is important]]
	* Basically a question of [[§Prioritisation]] and [[§Motivation]]. Still unsure about which feedback loops I want to establish, 
	* [[§Prioritisation]] is supported by having an overview of my current interesting projects, [[A Stack of Possibilities]].
* [[09/10/2021]]
	* In essence, this is a problem of [[§Prioritisation]]. Much has been said about these, but Andy has a good thread on them.
* [[11-Dec-21 - Homely]]
	* [[§Prioritisation]]
* [[Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman]]
	* The skill we want to support is [[§Prioritisation]], but I get the sense that I’m already quite OK at that?
	* [[§Prioritisation]]
* [[Having things be unsolved is the normal state of affairs]]
	* This means that we needn't rush to solve all problems; rather, we need to use [[§Prioritisation]] to select what is worth working on.
* [[How do I prioritise bandwidth for activity types?]]
	* This is an orthogonal dimension from [[Take action on your values to live a meaningful life]], which is a direction on [[§Prioritisation]] for exploting.
* [[Rather than learning from outcomes which actions are good, we can learn from our prediction of outcomes]]
	* That is based on those predictions being accurate, [[§Prioritisation]], [[§Planning]]
* [[The Paradigm Shift in Rationality with Anna Riedl]]
	* Being good at [[§Prioritisation]], but in the most general sense. Wisdom is choosing what is important to you. 
* [[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck]]
	* Might have insights into [[§Prioritisation]].
* [[Your Prioritization is Underspecified - LessWrong]]
	* How can this inform [[§Prioritisation]]?
