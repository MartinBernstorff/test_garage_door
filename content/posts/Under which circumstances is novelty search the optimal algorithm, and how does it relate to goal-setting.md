# Under which circumstances is novelty search the optimal algorithm, and how does it relate to goal-setting
Novelty search is a solution to the problem of deception, which can be explained as local optima deceving an objective based search algorithm into a dead end.

We can apply theory of constraints to this - even though we don't know what the objective is, there is going to be a constraint to optimise (time spent etc.)

Further, goal-setting may be possible by setting unspecific learning goals (ie. chasing a stepping stone at maximum speed) or process goals.

May be information in algorithms to live by.

How does it relate to goal-setting?

This is why we may need objectives, at least in the short term; it makes it possible to make decisions and to go after them with vigor.

Q. What is the advantage of novelty search?
A. It is resistant to local optima.

Q. Which algorithms does novelty search outcompete under deception?
A. Objective based algorithms, eg. [[Hill climbing]].

Q. What disadvantages does novelty search hold?
A. Poor at exploiting known local optima, ie. satisficing.
