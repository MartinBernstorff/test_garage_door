# Multitask learning
Q. What do we mean by multitask learning in ML?
A. Supervised training where the algorithm can solve multiple problems

Q. How does [[Multitask learning]] differ from [[Multiclass Classification]]?
A. [[Multiclass Classification]] is only one task - which class does a sample belong to. [[Multitask learning]] allows for multiple tasks â€“ e.g. answering both "car or bicycle" and "vehicle or person".

Q. Why can [[Multitask learning]] be beneficial?
A. 1) If the outputs are correlated, they supplement each other's signal as 'true' labels, 2) It makes it easier to spot anomalies, for example if a patient has a low risk of morbidity but astronomical medical bills

Q. How can [[Multitask learning]] be applied to clustered data (e.g. predictions between schools)?
A. Treat predictions at different schools as different tasks. Most of the model is common, the rest of the model is specific to the school.
