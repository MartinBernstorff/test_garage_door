# What I value in health
I value maintaining my body and mind, taking care of myself and loving myself.

In the long term, I want to be able to take a walk with my dog when I'm 70, and to do so comfortably. This means to avoid:

1. Diseases that affect my mental capacity
2. Diseases that affect cardiovascular capacity
3. Joint injuries/movement injuries
