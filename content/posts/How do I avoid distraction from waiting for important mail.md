# How do I avoid distraction from waiting for important mail
You want to *consider whether it is truly important*; if it doesn’t affect behaviour, then it probably doesn’t matter that much.

If it does, then see if you can’t *get the sender to contact you by phone*. This helps [[Avoid inboxes]].

If that doesn’t work either, or for senders you don’t have a relationship with, *get select alerts*. This can be done with some email apps, that allow notifications on a sender basis,  or Luxafor.

For the email clients, this will typically require you to set it up, and therefore challenges [[Avoid inboxes]].
