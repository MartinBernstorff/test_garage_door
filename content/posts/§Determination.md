* [[When am I working hard enough?]]
	* That means that there will be cases where I don’t desire working, and where I'll work anyway ([[§Determination]], [[§Effort]], [[§Resistance]]).

	* While [[Choosing is everything]], [[Choosing is fallible]]. [[§Determination]] comes from making a choice, but it doesn't last forever, so [[Building requires repeated attention]] ([[§Effort]]). 
* [[How do I title concept pages?]]
	* [[Note titles should work as APIs]], and ideally I want to be able to use them inline, like [[§Determination]]. On the other hand, mentally § is harder than using “on”.
