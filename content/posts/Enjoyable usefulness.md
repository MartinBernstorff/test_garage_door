Purposes are co-created in an appreciative, compassionate dance with the world.

Doesn't imply that all work will be enjoyable, and it *definitely* doesn't imply that all work should be effortless ([[Effortlessness]]). 

Rather, it implies that we should enjoy work when possible. Luckily, whether we apply effort and whethe we enjoy the work are probably unrelated. We can enjoy working hard while learning something new and difficult, or running a hard trail. After all, [[Challenge is intrinsically motivating]].

> There’s little evidence that most people have pre-existing passions waiting to be discovered, and believing that there’s a magical right job lurking out there can often lead to chronic unhappiness and confusion when the reality of the working world fails to match this dream.

* [[Pure hedonism isn’t wrong]]
	* But therein lies also its flaws. It doesn’t build relationships with others, it doesn’t build competence at anything. This means that, in the long term, it’s probably a poor choice for getting my basic psychological needs met. It’s something I want to do as relaxation, as a way of recuperating after a long day’s work or finishing a hard project – but it’s rarely meaningful to me in itself. Fiction books aren’t part of [[Enjoyable usefulness]].

	* Living a good life is about  [[Enjoyable usefulness]]. One lens for that is [[Basic Psychological Needs (BPN, SDT)]] fulfilment + intrinsic motivation.
* [[How hard should I work?]]
	* As an alternate approach, I want to live by [[§Nobility]] and [[Enjoyable usefulness]]. As such, I should work as hard as is meaningful; seek to rise so that I can serve others.

	* [[Enjoyable usefulness]]
* [[Purpose]]
	* For [[Enjoyable usefulness]] to happen, we need to find out both how we can enjoy ourselves and how we can be useful. This means exploring desires and passions, while also finding things that need doing, that allow us to be useful. These can serve as purposed.

* [[Is it helpful to categorise activities as “work”]]
	* Essentially, ideal work pace is based on push and pull:
Pull: [[Enjoyable usefulness]] 
	* That said, categorising something as “work” may make it harder to find the enjoyment in them. Rather, we might want to rate activities on a scale of [[Enjoyable usefulness]]. 
	* However, it’s typically relatively easy for me to reach that threshold. Whether (and how) to exceed that threshold, or spend my time in general, then becomes a question of how I think spending my time will lead to the most [[Enjoyable usefulness]]. 
* [[Nobility]]
	* It is a way of being, of manifesting glory for the benefit of others, of doing as much as we can to manifest [[Enjoyable usefulness]].
