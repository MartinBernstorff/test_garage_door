# §Technology for the betting table
This solves the problem in [[Betting table for research]].

I think [[Basecamp]] will be useful: 
* Ideas, information and comments can be shared on the specific idea in a threaded manner, 
* Co-authors can reply to most comments in their email if they desire it.

Potential problems are:
* Email overload, making them take emails less seriously if they’re from basecamp or from me. 
* Also, that they’re not interested in adding a new tool to their toolkit 
	* I think I can remedy this partially by letting them know that they can reply in email.

To probe the approach:
+ Check how good the sign-up flow is
	+ Do we need confirmation email
	+ How quick is it
+ See how easy it is to reply to emails
+ Talk to Bodil about the idea
+ [[Send out email]]
