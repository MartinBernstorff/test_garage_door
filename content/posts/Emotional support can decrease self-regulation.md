# Emotional support can decrease self-regulation
If the child or person isn't encouraged to regulate their own emotions, rather than supported, they won't have the time or ability to learn to self-regulate.

This is also clear in crying children, see studies in Roam.

There is also more evidence in SDT on parenting.
