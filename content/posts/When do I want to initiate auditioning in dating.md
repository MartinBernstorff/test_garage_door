# When do I want to initiate auditioning in dating
This is an [[Optimal stopping]] problem for [[Romantic Auditioning]].

As such, it depends on:
1. When do you have to commit by?
2. Which distribution do you think you're sampling from?

Assuming an "[Exponential Secretary](https://putanumonit.com/2019/03/03/exponential-secretary/)" and plotting by "number of dates left", you get a distribution like this: 
![date expectation](https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/date-expectation.png?w=900)

Given that I feel like I have a ton of dates left in me (like 30-ish), my expectations should be quite high. 

This also means that I need to let go of mediocre dates pretty rapidly, especially given the availability of interesting dates and the possibility of dating multiple people at once.
