# How do I best handle the continuing stream of inklings
I get the sense that throwing an idea away is a problem, a kind of waste. That is to some extent true, every idea could have become something that I'd find useful in the future.

But ideas are constantly generated in a never-ending stream, so saving all and leaving none is not a viable solution. My primary issue is not enough time spent thinking, and I want to protect that time ([[Building requires repeated attention]]). [[Retention is not valuable for its own sake]] and [[Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is]], and this goes for new ideas as well.

How do we handle them, then? We could filter them,  pruning out the least useful until we
end up with what we want. This adds substantial overhead, especially given the relatively high volume of new ideas and the relatively low volume of time spent pruning notes. If we filter at idea-generation, the cost is paid upfront instead â€“ and if the cost is lower than the cost of ingest, that's useful. I don't think it is right now, though.

Or we could revisit them in a more ad-hoc, but also less obligation-like way ([[Inboxes feel like obligations]]), [[Revisit inklings ad-hoc]].

I know from experience that I will conceive of some ideas that I'll know immediately are useful for something I'm working on right now. Those notes I want to filter somewhere special, but they have to be a small subset of all ideas I generate, otherwise the concept doesn't work.

[[Focusing on utility decreases intrinsic motivation]]

[[$Promote ideas by relevance]]

Something with increasing spacing if not fruitful?

How does it contrast with the flashcards I add?

Can I build a prototype with airtable?

### Implementation
* Allow increased prioritisation of notes that are useful for ongoing projects
* Keep a mechanism for allowing notes to remain in peripheral vision, eg. sending periodical emails with intersting ideas

## Backlinks
* [[Curate inflow of information]]
	* This is analogous to [[How do I best handle the continuing stream of inklings]], but for information from outside my own head.
* [[$My thinking system]]
	* The workflow depends on when a new idea is generated. If it's generated in context, it can easily be added. But if it's salient during something else, it has to be ingested in something inbox-like ([[How do I best handle the continuing stream of inklings]]).
	* I have more new writing prompts than I know what to do with. [[How do I best handle the continuing stream of inklings]].
