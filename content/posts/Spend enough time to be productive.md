# Spend enough time to be productive
For much of the work we do, it’s important to spend enough hours to make progress, and to stick with the practice to get better at it.

However, focusing on hours spent may lead to psychological problems – eg. working on something easy to rack up hours, not taking time to prioritise consciously, a shift towards [[External motivation (SDT)]].

To avoid this, use "time spent" not as a measure, but as an indicator of whether your motivational structure is properly setup ([[Align emotions and cognitions]]). 

A key problem then is, [[How much effort should we spend on projects]].

One way of increasing them, with caveats, [[My: Percentile feedback]].

Q. You notice you're not spending enough time to be productive on what matters to you. How might you go about changing that?
A. Beware, "time spent" is not a goal! However, it is an indicator of motivational structure – so [[Align emotions and cognitions]].
