## Done
### Planning
+ [[Might I weight observation-ratings by how long ago they were made?]]
+ [[Make it low friction to select and import from LWS to Complice]]
+ [[Weigh observation-ratings by their age]]
- [[How do I go from goal to activity to tried activity in TWS]]

### Review 
##### General
- [[$My implementation of review in LWS]]
+ [[When reviewing activities, only show if less than x probability]]
+ [[When reviewing and planning the day, might I collect alternatives that I'd like to have done]]

##### Periodic
+ [[Add a larger review function]]
	+ [[Add goals to life well spent]]
	+ [[My implementation to review goals for Life Well Spent]]

##### Daily
+ [[Make it low friction to move from Complice to  Life Well Spent review]]
	+ [[I can use the API to import now, may be worth it to use Integromat for]]
+ Allow archiving on log page

* [[Action menus should be shaped by experience]]
	* For leisure, we can have a feedback loop like [[$My Implementation of Life Well Spent (LWS)]] since there are many actions that we can do repeatedly.
* [[Action menus should be shaped by intention]]
	* One way of making this happen for [[$My Implementation of Life Well Spent (LWS)]] is [[Exponential decay]], e.g. for the ratings to be weighted by time.
	* Another way of it to be implemented is to select a value/goal and then be presented with actions that are congruent with those. This separates itself from the current implementation of [[$My Implementation of Life Well Spent (LWS)]], in that it keeps intention as the primary factor.
