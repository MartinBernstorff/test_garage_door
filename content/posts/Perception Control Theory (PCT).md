# Perception Control Theory (PCT)
[[Goals are important as reference states for control systems]]

How does PCT account for poor habits, like gaming or swiping fb?

Conflicts arise when there are two systems with competing reference conditions - e.g. relax and be productive, or turn up the heat while keeping the room cool. Or be an attentive listener to dad while being stimulated intellectually.

These conflicts can’t be resolved by changing how much you do the activity - you can’t be an attentive listener to a boring conversation - they can only be solved by changing 1) the situation or your perception of it, 2) whether you’re in the situation at all, 3) your reference conditions.

Negotiation is exploring how both parties can unify around a new reference condition.

Resolving conflict requires moving attention to the level where conflict resolution is possible - diagramming (e.g. [[Evaporating Cloud]]) can help with that.
