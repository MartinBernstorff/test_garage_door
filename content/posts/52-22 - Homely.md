# 52-22 - Homely
This next week is mostly affected by me having the suspicion of COVID. The counter to this is a test tomorrow, and another PCR 2 days before New Year’s.

For this, I need to talk to Mads as well about their expectations, and what they can get from Simon and I.

I’d love to see Pernille as well! Probably just let her know today, and be up-front about COVID-PCR test.

I also have a bunch of possible projects to work on!

I have a bunch of interesting options, too! For example:
* Get better at [[Unit testing \/ test driven development \/ TDD in R]]

* [[80k hours]] - I might use their application form to reflect on what I want out of my career, and maybe talk to them about how I might have the greatest impact with the current set of skills. 

* Work on [[Log: Clairvoyance tutorial]] - can I get it to perform better?

* Design [[Vestervang 34, 1 mf]]

* Social activities with
	* Pernille
	* Simon
	* Mads
	* Lasse/Kenneth?
