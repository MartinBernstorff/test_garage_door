# Lists of Opportunities
When I make a list of things I’d like to do (like podcasts I’d like to listen to), it simulatenously serves multiple functions:

* It’s a [[§Caching]] (it makes it faster for me to find the podcast) 

* An [[§Archive]] (it allows me to select podcasts I might’ve forgotten about)

## Backlinks
* [[§Buffer (flow theory)]]
	* [[Lists of Opportunities]]
