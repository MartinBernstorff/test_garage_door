# Do the most uncertain thing first
If you’re doing work on a project, do the most uncertain thing first. If it doesn’t work, you may want to drop the project. If it takes a long time, you need to know that as soon as possible so that you can cut the scope of the rest of the project. 

Q. Why do you want to do the most uncertain part of a project first?
A. To decrease risk, and increase morale
