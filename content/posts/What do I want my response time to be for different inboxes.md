# What do I want my response time to be for different inboxes
# §Checking frequency for inboxes
How does this affect notification and/or checking strategy?

It really depends on the inbox. To figure this out, it makes sense first to get an overview of which inboxes I have.

[[§My inboxes]]

It is probably dynamic:
* If I’m waiting for an important email, I might want response time to be faster.
* If I'm on vacation, I can let people know that my response time is much slower (and to reach my on my phone if required)

This is a way to [[Avoid toil]].
