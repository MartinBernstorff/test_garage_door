# Do we make motivational material part of daily life
[[Align emotions and cognitions]]

It may be helpful to be able to trigger motivation for specific subjects.

For example, in modern life, we are often not in touch with the people that benefit from our work. This contact is highly motivating and helps integrate motivations, so missing out on it is a huge shame.

Artificial material might be a poor substitute, but it is most likely better than nothing. After all, imagination is what has brought some of the greatest benefits to humanity.

On the other hand, most of the work that I am doing is motivating just from circumstance. I like to collaborate and to nerd out, which satisfies motivation for my PhD. 

If I am going to be a doctor I will have direct contact with my patients.
