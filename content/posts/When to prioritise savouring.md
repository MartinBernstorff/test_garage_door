# When to prioritise savouring
Experience, in the sense of mindfully being aware of what's happening around me, allows me to relax ([[MIL balances stimulation and relaxation]]), and allows me to enjoy life more ([[Balance flow and experience]]). 

We should prioritise more experience, then, if life is feeling too busy or if there are opportunities to enjoy life through experience.
