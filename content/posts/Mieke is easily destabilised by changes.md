Mieke is easily destabilized by changes

Examples are moving in together, her brother getting a new girlfriend, renovation of our bathroom.

She gets easily annoyed, angry, has trouble sleeping, isn't interested in me sexually. She won't kiss me with a worker next door.

I worry how that bodes for our future, where much more dramatic changes are very likely to happen.
