# Add goals to life well spent
Eg. as a separate table, where next actions could be linked as a record in "Activities". 

Since I'm using taskheat for planning, it would require some manual syncing. For now (27/03/2021), that means that next actions won't be in Airtable.

[[Add next actions for goals to Life Well Spent]]

To make sure most/all goals have a "next action" available, I could use: [[My implementation to review goals for Life Well Spent]].
