# Meeting with Bodil, 19/11/2020
* PhD
	* I’m moving it up the priority list
	* I’m not sure that epidemiology is a good path for solving the problems with non-specific symptoms
		* I think we need causal understanding
		* I’m not sure which problems we can solve with epidemiology
	* I’ll explore other opportunities
		* Loved working with you guys, would definitely like to do a PhD!
		* If they have ideas, I’m very open to exploring those
		* Will also reach out to others I know for opportunities
			* Also some at the faculty, if that’s OK
			* Will definitely look for opportunities to cooperate with you, has been a pleasure.
* Article 3
	* Not much spontaneous progress
	* I’m thinking of setting up a meeting next week, and to encourage people to write at least a small “I think this is a good idea” reply if they think a given idea is feasible.
		- R- og Z-diagnoser. Findes R-diagnoserne uden en b-diagnose med den underliggende ætiologi? Altså er de faktisk udtryk for det uspecifikke vi vil bruge dem til?
		- R- diagnoser, kan de være første kontakt, og så viderehenvisning til et forløb?
