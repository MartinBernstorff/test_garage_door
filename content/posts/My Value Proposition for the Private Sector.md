# My Value Proposition for the Private Sector
My value proposition is integrating the epidemiological, data science perspective (where are the opportunities, how might it fail, what is feasible, easy, cheap) with the clinical perspective (where are the challenges, what might be high impact). 

I’m also a people person: I can understand needs, wants and emotional states quickly, and leverage that to create harmonious, high-functioning teams. I am proactive, I visualise where the work is going, and I can spot and clear challenges before they become roadblocks ([[Gødstrup IT-implementation]]).
