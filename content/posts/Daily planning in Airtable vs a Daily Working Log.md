# Daily planning in Airtable vs a Daily Working Log
The advantages of using an open note are many, primarily that I can have:
* A greater sense of freedom of thought, 
* I can easily switch between different levels of detail in my planning
* Makes me more introspective
	* If I feel resistance towards an activity, it's easier to switch towards the *why* of the activity 
	* I (to a greater extent) allow my intentions and current headspace to dictate where I spend my time and energy
		* As long as I make wise choices (which I believe I tend to do), that is good!

I think that'll allow for intrinsic motivation and autonomy to a greater extent (i.e. an extension of [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]]), and then I can use [[§Warroom]] as scaffolding when required – e.g. when I don't know what to use an afternoon for. 

It doesn't collect information for the feedback loops in [[Daily planning in Airtable]],
