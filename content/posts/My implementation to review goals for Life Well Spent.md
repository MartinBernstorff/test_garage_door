# My implementation to review goals for Life Well Spent
For [[$My Implementation of Life Well Spent (LWS)]].

* [[Use values to select goals]]

Some values are best served by having goals; there are end states that help us live by our values.

Making those goals explicit helps us get the benefits from [[Â§Goals]].

The review is about:
1. Prioritising between goals and habitual activities
2. Considering whether goals are still a good fit for values
3. Considering if there are goals I want to add

[[Do I want to review work and leisure together]]
