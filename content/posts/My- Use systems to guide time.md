# My: Use systems to guide time
[[Systems should guide towards the desired state]], andthis is probably useful for dedicating time to work! You want to work a sufficient amount of time, but reserve time for leisure and exploration.

This illustrates a basic tenet of time; we don't want to waste it in both a positive and negative sense ([[Don't waste time]]). We want to spend time working on something (rather than being distracted by a TV-series), but we also don't want to just work on whatever to rack up hours.

One way of doing it is to use [[My: Percentage feedback]] to give fast feedback while using a beeminder "do less" goal (probably with auto-ratcheting) to avoid overwork, and to guide towards optimising use of time for effectiveness.

I think this might help [[Increase andon]].

How does this relate to time tracking? And informational feedback? What else do I know?
