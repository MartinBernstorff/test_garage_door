# Idea-generation is most likely my biggest weakness
This can be solved either by finding collaborators or by getting better at it myself.

For my career-planning, what a "good" idea means depends somewhat on where I want to work, and what kind of work I want to do.

Exploring ideas, then, is useful â€“ especially if I expect to act upon them before starting to work full time. However, I will be getting mroe information as I start to work full time (about which specialty I'll prefer etc.)
