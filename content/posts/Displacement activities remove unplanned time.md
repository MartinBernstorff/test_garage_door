# Displacement activities remove unplanned time
This removes the necessary time to slow down, to feel [[Â§Boredom]], which motivates you to reflect on what you want your life to be like, [[Do your own thinking]]. 

After all, [[Life is short]], so [[Life is too short for highly engaging displacement activities]].
