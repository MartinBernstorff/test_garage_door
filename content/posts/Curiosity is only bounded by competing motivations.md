# Curiosity is only bounded by competing motivations
Most of this hinges on [[Attention is zero-sum]].

I don't think our desire for novelty is zero-sum, but I think it is affected by whether we're still getting the extrinsic rewards we expect. 
 
E.g. if we spend all our time on [[§Shallow novelty]], we don't get increases in [[Competence (SDT)]], so we don't satisfy our basic psychological needs. Or, if we're highly challenged, there's not enough cognitive resources left for exploration and novelty. 

In that sense, the only way we need to protect against novelty is to avoid a "crowding-out" effect of [[§Shallow novelty]] on other, more valuable activities. We need to [[Protect attention]], so we can [[Spend attention well]] and [[Spend time well]].
