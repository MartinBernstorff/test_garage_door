# §Problem solving
A strong model is something like:
1. [[Define the problem]]
2. [[Shape the strategy]]
3. [[Probe the approach]]
4. [[Do the work]]
5. [[Learn from outcomes]]

Often, ideas are what become psychologically salient. But doing the above is likely to be tremendously useful!

	* This ties into [[§Problem solving]] – most of what I do in my life is about solving problems, and then we have a small subset that is just about experiences.

* [[Clearer process misses the point; what matters is better outcomes]]
	* I fear that I have a tendency to make processes clearer and more explicit (eg. [[§Problem solving]] and [[$My research system]], without keeping in mind whether this clarification actually improves the process.

	* [[Hill charts]] are mostly useful for communicating. When communicating with yourself, they might be useful. It’s can become part of the [[§Problem solving]] vocabulary.
