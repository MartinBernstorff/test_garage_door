# Do we want to separate predictions into bleeds and clots
For CVD, I imagine that there are two “clusters” of outcomes:

Cardiovascular
	1. Clots

Cerebrovascular
	1. Bleeds
	2. Clots

Since bleeds and clots likely have different (overlapping) clusters of causal mechanisms, they also likely have different, but overlapping, clusters of predictors. This means it can be beneficial to treat different models; unless the loss of data is larger than the gain of having more specific predictors.
