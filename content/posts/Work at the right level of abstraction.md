# Work at the right level of abstraction
Problem solving is the most effective at the relevant level of abstraction.

what do I mean by level of abstraction? 

Abstractions typically generalize better, because they capture only the most relevant features of a situation.

What indicates that your concepts are too general?
* You can't make confident predictions (underfitting), because the underlying causal model is too vague

* Your model doesn't yield concrete actions

*Or too specific a concept?*
* The concept rarely fits anything, because it is tied to the particulars

* You are over-confident in your predictions, because you think particulars are part of the causal model

Part of my knowledge on [[Problem solving]].

How might a question like 'your patient has an acute headache. What are the likely mechanisms?' work? Probably not that well yet, because we often don't have a good answer.
