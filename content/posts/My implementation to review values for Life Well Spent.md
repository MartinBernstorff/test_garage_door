# My implementation to review values for Life Well Spent
For [[$My Implementation of Life Well Spent (LWS)]].

The point of this is to:
1. Balance values
	1. Notice if I'm neglecting a value
2. Figure out if there are values missing
3. Figure out if chosen activities are effectively in service of those values
4. See if certain values are well served with goals as well

I want to keep it light weight, so a quick overview of each value and how it's going is probably a good start.
