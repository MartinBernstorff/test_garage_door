# The magic wand
a. I wave this magic wand and you have the total approval of everyone on the planet--no matter what you do, they love, respect, and admire you--whether you become a surgeon or a serial killer. What would you then do with your life? How would you treat others?

b. I wave this magic wand, and all these painful thoughts, feelings, and memories no longer have any impact on you. What would you do with your life? What would you start, stop, do more of, or less of? How would you behave differently? If we watched you on a video, what would we see and hear that would show us magic had happened?
