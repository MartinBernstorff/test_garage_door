# 16-Dec-21 - Work
*How am I feeling today?*
Was a bit stressed yesterday evening, getting the new work wasn't cost-free. This ties into [[Look into the rest-weighted hour]], to better gauge task-importance in [[Impact Density Scheduling]]. The "duration" shouldn't be duration per se, it should be the effort-adjusted hour. A 10-minute google search didn't reveal it, though, so there's a challenge in finding it.

It's called [[Neutral hour]]! Might be worth taking your most frequent activities and estimating their neutral-hours costs – and see how well that matches your current way of spending time. Maybe even use [YNAB-style prioritising](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wllgq9PxWWFIQ2veUnJl3GfKpDvTwNVQQUeQeXmjUAA/edit#gid=1443084366) to see how your weeks look.
