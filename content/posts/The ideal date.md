# The ideal date
The ideal date can probably, in the abstract, be typified. 

Firstly and most importantly, it needs to get us information about whether this potential partner fits us well ([[§My Vision of My Partner]]) and give them information about whether we fit them well.

This implies a bunch of things! For [[Value curiosity]], we need to talk together, and I can ask questions like "What do you find interesting right now?". ([[The ideal date allows conversation]])

[[Value caring]] comes almost intuitively, and I haven't missed the beat on that one yet.

[[§Nobility]] can also be intuited. 

Secondly, it facilitates (and makes possible) physical and mental attraction. It is fun, upbeat, and typically associated with positive affect ([[The ideal date facilitates physical proximity]], [[The ideal date is swimming in positive affect]]).
