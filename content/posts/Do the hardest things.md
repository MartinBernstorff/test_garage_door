# Do the hardest things
Most companies and associations tend to be risk averse. This means that there is huge potential in taking risks.

Furthermore, when you tackle something that’s extraordinarily hard:
* People know it’s very hard, so they want you to succeed
* It becomes easier to focus, because you have to to have any chance of succeeding

To find it, ask someone on the team what the important problem is.

This issue will often remain unsolved to avoid cognitive dissonance - if this important issue could be solved, why haven’t we yet?

Working on hard problems tends to give autonomy. It’s also tremendously motivating.

But it’s different from the regular work.  Most people is used to long work, where you just show up and put in the hours. Hard work is emotionally challenging; it’s so hard that you might fail.
