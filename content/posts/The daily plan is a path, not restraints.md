# The daily plan is a path, not restraints
Probably not very! I want the daily plan to be a list of my intentions, of what I truly believe is the right thing to do. It's not a set of a restraints, it's a path.

Invariably, it'll have crossroads. These are times to reflect, times that allow you to carve a better path.
