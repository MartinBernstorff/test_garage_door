# Intuition is emergent heuristics

## Backlinks
* [[Use heuristics]]
	* Heuristics can be developed both unconsciously ([[Intuition is emergent heuristics]]) and consciously ([[Deliberate about models]], [[All models are heuristics]]).
	* When do heuristics especially fool us? I think especially when [[Intuition is emergent heuristics]], and we fail to evaluate whether there's reason to believe that we have accurate intuition in this area (whether feedback is available, whether feedback is valid and amount of practice). 
* [[§Intuition]]
	* [[Intuition is emergent heuristics]]
* [[§Emotions]]
	* [[Emotions are emergent heuristics about actions for values]], just like more broadly, [[Intuition is emergent heuristics]].
* [[23-Dec-21 - Homely]]
	* How do we entrain heuristics? [[Intuition is emergent heuristics]]
* [[Practice like a scientist, perform like an artist]]
	* Evidence can inform intuition, allowing us to get the best from empirical measurements while getting the pleasant [[Flow]] experience of [[Use heuristics]] and [[§Intuition]] ([[Intuition is emergent heuristics]]).
