# Unsure: Quantification as a nudge is controlling
Iâ€™m very fearful of [[Quantification decreases intrinsic motivation]], because when quantification itself becomes the behavioural nudge, that tends to undermine autonomy as well. 

Nudging in this sense means changing behaviour without the agent knowing that it's being changed. If it become salient that the agent is no longer acting according to their desires, then the nudge is controlling.

Instead, [[Keep feedback informational]].
