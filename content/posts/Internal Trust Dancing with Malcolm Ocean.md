# Internal Trust Dancing with Malcolm Ocean
How does this mesh with [[How Emotions are Made]]?

[Write-up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrGei1AioJ5Mzdzrv0cI9ISPogMvDiYc1fJKJGMOXuw/edit?ts=60f4e878#heading=h.idwewderhjgw)

Q. What might the long-term consequences be of overruling some of your own preferences?
A. The part of you with the preference panics, and turns its signal up to 11 â€“ resulting in oscillating behaviours. For example, work super hard, then be a couch potato for weeks.

Q. How might we explain oscillating between working hard and relaxing?
A. Two competing control systems. Analogous to a space heater and an air-conditioner interacting with delay.

Q. How might we reconcile two parts of you with different preferences?
A. 1) Explore behaviours that satisfy both parts, 2) Dialogue and experiment

Q. How might we respond to two IFS-style subparts resuming a tug-of-war?
A. Dialogue again to see how we can modify the experiment to reach harmony.

Q. How might we phrase the core of an IFS-style dialogue?
A. Part 1: "Hey, I don't want to fight. Can we work together? I know you don't trust me, but I'd like to build trust with you."
