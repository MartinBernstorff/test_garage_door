# Add probabilistic automatic decay to incremental thinking	
The ideal state is that I’m excited to do incremental thinking, and I have interesting prompts to work on each day. So far, this is the case, so probabilistic decay may not quite be necessary yet.

Adding automatic probabilistic decay would allow for automatic pruning of the inbox, which might:
* Avoid a sense of inbox-overflow
	* Probably not; you don’t know if the most important ideas are getting pruned
* Allow new ideas to get to the top of the bin
	* True, and this might increase excitement
* Allow ideas I’m working on to stay on top (especially if they’re somehow “immunised”, like adding a “working on” tag that is removed only if pressing “next”), avoiding spreading myself too thin idea-wise ([[Building requires repeated attention]], [[Balance exploration and specialisation]])
	* The counter-factual to this can easily be tried by increasing delay for p1 prompts. That would essentially promote prompts that I’m working on - however, I currently don’t modify the priority of prompts that I edit.
