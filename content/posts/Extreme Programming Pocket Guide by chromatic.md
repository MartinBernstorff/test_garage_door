Which of these principles can we use to move faster?

When writing good code, it’s imperative to have good feedback. This means: planning, designing, testing and communicating.

The more rapid feedback is, the easier it is to [[Quality check at low value]].

Feedback mechanisms:
1. Testing the plan
2. Pair-programming
3. Unit-testing

*Practice 1: Keep Code Simple*
To maintain simplicity:
1. Do the simplest thing that could possibly work
2. You Aren’t Gonna Need It, only implement what you need *now*. The future is hard to predict.
3. Once and Only Once

Simplicity saves resources in implementation. For code, simple code is easier to test, maintain and change.

> Complexity costs a lot and predicting the future is hard. You have to wait for the future to see if you were right. So keep things simple and agile.

*Practice 2: Refactor Mecilessly*
* Learn refactoring patterns, [[§Refactoring]]
* Figure out how to do those refactorings in your IDE, [[Refactoring in VSCode]]

Requires that you have:
* Comprehensive tests, so you don’t break things
* Coding standards if working with others, so you don’t break subjective things

*Adopt [[§Test driven development (TDD)]].*

*Use [[§Pair programming]]*
