# Mike Anki make it harder for us to do relevance realisation
And, by extension, make us less intelligent? Maybe, as a counter, we might ask [[What determines how often we want to see a prompt]], and then reframe the buttons to be 'more or less frequent', allowing our [[Relevance Realisation]] to guide prompt frequency. 

We still augment long-term memory, but we do it more intelligently.
