For counterarguments to many of these thoughts, see [[Shape up]].

The point of project management is to help us get the project done faster, with less frustration, and with less uncertainty.

It does have quite a few pitfalls, though! 

It can become a tool of control, undermining [[Autonomy (SDT)]]. To the extent that it feels like you're informed by others or by the system, rather than assisted by them, you will lose motivation.

Overhead is another issue; if you want detailed estimates, you need to enter a *ton* of information – who is doing a task, how long the task takes, task dependencies.

Furthermore, much of that information is itself highly uncertain! This means that you estimate will be highly uncertain - albeit, if the estimates are unbiased, you will get the benefit of the [[Central Limit Theorem]]. 

*Pain-points it can solve*
* Not knowing what to work on - [[Recognise dependencies]]
	* What is urgent
		* What are others waiting on me for
		* What will others be waiting on me for in the future - [[§Critical Chain]]
	* What is important
		* What doesn't matter much

Mechanically, the first step is to [[Recognise dependencies]], so that we can:
* [[Decrease dependencies]] if at all possible
* Work hard when we're on the [[§Critical Chain]]
