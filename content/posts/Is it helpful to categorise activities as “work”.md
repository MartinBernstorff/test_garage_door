# Is it helpful to categorise activities as “work” 
TODO: Perhaps categorising as work and non-work means that [[Compartmentalisation helps focus]]

We might want to do this to avoid typical issue: you let work take over most of your life, because that’s where you get feedback. You then have a hard time relaxing, and that’s the problem. 

If that is the case, you might instead categorise activities by whether they were relaxing or not, and then ensure that you have enough time for relaxation. 

There are certain expectations around how fast you progress for work, whereas there are few expectations around recreation. Part of the feedback loop for work, then, is based on a lower-bound threshold.

Essentially, ideal work pace is based on push and pull:
Push: Expectations around my obligations
Pull: [[Enjoyable usefulness]] 

The “push” activities are the ones I want to categorise as “work”, so that I can set an upper bound on them. This helps preserve my mental health, keep me a healthy human being.

That said, categorising something as “work” may make it harder to find the enjoyment in them. Rather, we might want to rate activities on a scale of [[Enjoyable usefulness]]. 

However, it’s typically relatively easy for me to reach that threshold. Whether (and how) to exceed that threshold, or spend my time in general, then becomes a question of how I think spending my time will lead to the most [[Enjoyable usefulness]]. 

Eg. interpreting some work activities as recreational (any that I'd complete even without their effect on career) ([[Activities aren't work if you'd still do them for recreation]]).
