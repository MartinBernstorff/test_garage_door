# Mieke is more materialistic than I am
So far, it hasn't had any meaningful consequences, but what I fear is:
1. [[I fear we have to have an expensive home]]
2. I fear we have to spend a lot of energy managing perceptions

And that these expenditures will collide with [[I value autonomy]], [[I value making the world a better place]].

Money buys some things very well and others poorly —know which is which and buy the former.

Currently, I find this highly unlikely! Mieke doesn't fit well with the extrinsic items in the [[Aspiration Index]], and I find it highly likely that she'll be flexible in the light attachment she has to them.
