# §Activity types
*Maintenance*: Has an ideal interval that we want maintained, but can be adjusted slightly and skipped given circumstances.

*Mandatory one-timers*, eg. getting rear bike wheel fixed. Typically not part of a larger whole, but rather prompted maintenance.

*Goal-directed action*: Moving towards something we want to accomplish. Part of a larger whole. Very well captured by eg. Complice.

*Non-mandatory one-timers*, eg. fixing Mieke’s from handle. Increasing interval when skipping, delete after N skips.
