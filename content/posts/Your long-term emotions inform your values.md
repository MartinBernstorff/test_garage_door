# Your long-term emotions inform your values
Given that [[Emotions are unstable]] and [[A meaningful life contains discomfort]], we can't let our short-term emotions dictate our actions – this would lead to [[Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering]].

Instead, you want your long-term emotions to help you [[§Clarify your values to know which actions to take]], [[Use values to select goals]], and [[Use goals to select actions]].

For this to actually happen, [[Structure is necessary for a meaningful life]]. That doesn't mean that there can't be spontaneity, but it does mean that that spontaneity is best if it's value driven, if it leads you to a richer, more meaningful life.
