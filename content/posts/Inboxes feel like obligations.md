	* Q. Why might we want to decrease use of inboxes?
* [[Keeping media salient without inboxes]]
	* The general idea is to avoid [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], but also spending too much time collecting media ([[Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is]]) and/or browsing media that has high novelty but makes little difference in your life ([[Artificial novelty distracts from true exploration]]).
* [[$Make time for exploration]]
	* My general considerations are that I don't want to use inboxes ([[Inboxes feel like obligations]]).
* [[$Self-recommendations]]
	* One of the solutions to [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], based on the [[§General principles for optional activities]].
	* [[Motivation is increased by salience]], so we need to keep options salient. But [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], so we don't present a list. Rather, we send an email with a recency-weighted pseudorandom sample periodically – an email "newsletter" based on recommendations from your past self.
* [[Gratitude should be prompted to increase well-being]]
	* You want to do it in a way that doesn't make it feel like an obligation, eg. avoid [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], but that also makes it happen relatively frequently.
* [[§General principles for optional activities]]
	* For that to happen, they must remain salient ([[Motivation is increased by salience]]) without feeling like obligations ([[Inboxes feel like obligations]] [[Salience of utility strangles fun]]).

	* Or we could revisit them in a more ad-hoc, but also less obligation-like way ([[Inboxes feel like obligations]]), [[Revisit inklings ad-hoc]].
* [[§Principles for improving on research]]
	* Right now, I have many research points in my notes, without being reminded of them nor making much progress on them. Essentially, they're an inbox, but [[Inboxes feel like obligations]].
* [[D: It's hard to start writing Evergreens]]
	* Having a specific routine, like [[§Incremental thinking]], can make it much easier to get started. It runs the risk of [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], but since the postpone mechanism is lightweight, it may circumvent it. The best way to know is to try. 
* [[How do I nurture curiosity for Evergreen-sprouts]]
	* You want to avoid having a strict inbox to process since [[Inboxes feel like obligations]].
* [[How should the personal mnemonic medium prioritise cards]]
	* For the [[§The Personal Mnemonic Medium (general concept)]], most of what I add is interesting and useful, but not required. Since [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], having a fixed amount of work (that piles up) to do is not the most helpful.
