# When to prioritise execution
I'm not sure about whether this is the right way of splitting it for prioritising. While it isn't too rare that I feel like "executing" rather than "researching", I think it's more related to whether I'd like more mastery or more curiosity – and even moreso whether I have an attractive research or an attractive execution project ready.
