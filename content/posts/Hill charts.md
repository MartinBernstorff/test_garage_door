# Hill charts
Hill charts easily capture at what point in an idea process you are, and how much uncertainty is left.

Just like walking up a hill, when you’re planning something, in the first phases you don’t really know how much work there is to do. Even as you start building, there’s going to be a bunch of assumptions that haven’t been tested. 

Only as you start testing things and are so far along that you’re pretty confident there aren’t any more unknowns are you at the top of the hill.
