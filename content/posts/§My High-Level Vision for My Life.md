# §My High-Level Vision for My Life
The good life consists of service to something larger than yourself. This is manifests through two prongs, great work ([[§My Vision for Work]]) and rich relationships ([[§My Vision for Friendships]], [[§My Vision for a Tribe]], [[§My Vision for a Partnership]], [[§My Vision for a Family]]).

	* The most important stuff in my life is the same as yesterday, primarily partner-related ([[§My High-Level Vision for My Life]], [[§My Vision for a Partnership]]). This also feeds into work-related choices, like how hard I want to push data-science. It's probably time to get some guidance relatively soon, so that I can tailor my experiences and my learning to where I want to go.
