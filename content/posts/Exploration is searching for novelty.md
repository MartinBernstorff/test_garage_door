# Exploration is searching for novelty
Q. What is the global purpose of exploration?
A. To discover something interesting.

Since many fields have explored large areas, you may need to specialise to be able to do exploration that is novel not only to you, but also to the world.

For utility, things worth discovering are either a step towards solving a problem, or just interesting :-)
