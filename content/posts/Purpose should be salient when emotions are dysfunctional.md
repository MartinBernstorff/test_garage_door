# Purpose should be salient when emotions are dysfunctional
Having purposes be salient all the time is probably not the ideal â€“ we want to [[Protect attention]], and that means that purposes are to be salient when that is useful.

That typically means that it makes sense to examine purpose when we either 1) have conflicting emotions, or 2) when we feel emotions ought to be salient ([[Emotions are emergent heuristics about actions for values]]).
