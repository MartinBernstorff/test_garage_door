# What I value in education and personal development

I value reflecting on how my life is going, something like what I'm doing in Obsidian. This gives me a sense of growth, of becoming better over time, and of being creative.

2. What new skills or knowledge would you like to gain?

3. What further education or training appeals to you?

4. What sort of student/trainee would you like to be?
