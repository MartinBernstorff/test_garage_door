# How do I nurture curiosity for Evergreen-sprouts
You want to avoid having a strict inbox to process since [[Inboxes feel like obligations]].

You can sort your notes by last edited. The consequences of that are multiple. It works as positive feedback loop; as you're learning and editing more and more about a topic, you'll also be subjected to more about that topic.

It means that notes might disappear; if they're not linking to any note, and they're not linked to, they're highly unlikely to ever resurface. This may not be a problem, it may even be useful: meaningful thoughts are never pure orphans, see [[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]

At a macro-level, this increases your odds of specialisation. It is an organic way of making your inbox reflect your interests. In that way, it's quite an interesting experiment.

Does that mean I want to delete notes that aren't linking to anything, and aren't linked to? Probably yes, but I don't know how to detect if any other note is linking to it. Perhaps by looking for the note title in other notes. That's interesting!
