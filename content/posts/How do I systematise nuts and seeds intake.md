# How do I systematise nuts and seeds intake
Is this worth it? Let's check DALYs:

236 DALYs per 100,000 years, ie. 0,2 years or 73 days. 

Given the cost of lets say 15,- a day for the rest of my life:
15*365*60 = 328.500, or 2.190 hours or 92 days. So not worth it. Even worse for fruit. It's close, and I'll do it roughly correctly, but not incredibly important (if I'm average, and I'm probably above average I'd wager).
