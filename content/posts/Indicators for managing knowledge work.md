# Indicators for managing knowledge work
These are general principles, but the true question is: Which problems are these solving?



The idea is to ensure that there is stuff to work on (eg. a buffer), while keeping to [[Balance WIP]].

Some quality indicator

It’s about being able to spot problems before they happen. Now, you can easily overreact, so pair indicators. Use an indicator (Eg. inventory), and its potential counter-indicator (incidence of shortages).

This may apply to goals, that I can use balance goals.

It’s important to [[Get feedback that supports BPN]].

Leading indicators allow for problems to be found and corrected early. They only work if you trust them enough for you to actually take action on them.
