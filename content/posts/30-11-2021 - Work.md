# 30/11/2021 - Work
*How am I feeling today?*
Very good! Most things are going as hoped, and the major uncertainties around the apartment (asbestos, vådrumsmembran) have been resolved. This leaves it as a relatively good deal - the next steps are getting the offer and financing. All very good!

Still some uncertainty about Pernille, but it's minor. I fully expect us to resolve that too. 

With that in place, energy is freed up to work on my career again. Fantastically aligned with my vision for my future, very good!
