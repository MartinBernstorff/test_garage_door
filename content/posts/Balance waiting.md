# Balance waiting
Waiting isn't wasted â€“ it's time to be mindful, to relax and to do other things. But excessive waiting, or waiting that requires vigilance, is tremendously unpleasant.

To balance the amount of waiting: 
* [[Theory of Constraints]] on the step that is causing the waiting
* Designing processes so that there's continuous flow. Eg. if an item/meeting has lead time, setup a lead indicator for it. 
	* If multiple resources,  [[Optimise the critical chain]].

To make waiting more pleasurable:
* Make it obvious that busywork is not encouraged; if you're waiting, and you don't have meaningful value adding activities, explore and have fun!
* Set up a good system to avoid vigilance
