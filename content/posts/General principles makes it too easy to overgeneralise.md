# General principles makes it too easy to overgeneralise
How might this apply to the mnemonic medium? Eg. how can I integrate examples? Examples are essentially unit tests for principles. [[Backtest principles]].

Might I ask 'how would you do xyz situation differently?' and then point to the principle? Also point forward, eg. recall a case where xyz, or 'imagine a case in the future where xyz'. Essentially a TAP, but also entrancing the pattern.
