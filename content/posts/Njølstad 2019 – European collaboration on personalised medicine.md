# Njølstad 2019 – European collaboration on personalised medicine
To create individualised prediction, prevention and therapy.

For therapy, we hope to:
1. Discovering genomic variants that pinpoint druggable pathways
2. Aiding in the reclassification of disease diagnoses (to generate new taxonomies that can be treated more effectively)
3. Facilitating the stratification of populations on the basis of risk-factor susceptibility or therapeutic response (to optimise prevention or treatment)

Me: I think 2 and 3 are basically the same.
