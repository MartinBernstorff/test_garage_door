# How might I debug easily with just a subset of the data in R?
I'm thinking setting a "debug" flag, but that will require overwriting the data frames or having a separate set of variables.

Alternatively, I can store two nested data frames in each variable, one sampled and one complete. The flag can then control which one is being used for the computations.
