# Senn 2018 – Statistical pitfalls of personalised medicine
Just because only one subset register a measurable improvement, doesn’t mean that they are somehow special. There can just as easily be a  general improvement in everyone, but a level of noise due to outside factors.

To test this, we can test the same drug to placebo in the same individual more than once – ie. does extraordinary response at t1 predict extraordinary response at t2?

For pain score or cholesterol level, predictions for an individual – based on the average of the entire population – can be more accurate than predictions based on one measurement from the individual. This implies that one experience from an individual may actually tell that individual less about the true effect than the average experience of the population – unless there’s good reason to believe that the causality is different for this individual than for others.
