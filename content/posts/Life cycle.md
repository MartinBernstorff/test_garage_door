# Life cycle
In addition to the baby question, what else do you anticipate doing or having in your life? What would you like your life to be like, not just in the next few years, but through the whole cycle from now to midlife to retirement, aging? In five years, ten years, twenty years, forty years? What do you want to experience in addition to, or instead of parenting?

You might consider your current job, a career change, travel or living in another country, volunteer causes, sports or artistic pursuits. These activities may be something you did before you got bogged down with your career, something you’ve never done before, or something you do now, say hiking, that you would like to do more in the future.

Let’s say you became a parent two years from now. If you had a child, how would your child’s stages, e.g., infancy, pre-school, elementary school dovetail with your other goals and interests? For instance, if in five years you want to be focusing on parenting, then your three-year old’s preschool stage would be a good fit. On the other hand, if you plan to do archeology in a third-world country, that might be a challenge for keeping your child safe.

How would a child’s development coincide with the different stages in your own development? Reading Chapter 5, “Which Way Happiness?” may help you name your goals for your own development and consider whether a child’s developmental stages would be compatible.
