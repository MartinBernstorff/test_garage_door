# We largely control how we respond to emotions
This is like the Buddhist analogy of the ocean. While the surface is constantly changing, we can take a deep breath and go to the bottom ([[The observing self]]), where there is always calm.

This doesn't mean we'll feel calm, but it does mean we can take action aligned with our values.

Emotions typically include (examples for anxiety):
1. Physical changes (raised BP/HR, increased sweating)
2. Sensations (tightness in chest, racing heart)
3. Urges (to run away)
4. Action tendencies (fidget/talk rapidly)

However, we largely control to which extent we respond to 3 and 4.
