# How Emotions are Made
Emotions are not hard-wired in an ancient, “reptilian” part of the brain

Emotions cannot be detected through facial expressions or any other physiological measurement

There are no “universal” emotions across people, nations, or cultures

There are no distinct parts of the brain dedicated to specific emotions (such as the amygdala for fear)

Emotions are not “reactions” to external events.

Emotions (the name of them) is a concept that describes a range of physiological changes. E.g. tension and racing heart for “anxiety”.

Emotions (the reaction and qualia) is a result of predictive processing; what typically happens in this situation? What is most helpful?

> Many of these “budgetary changes” we experience as emotional experiences. 
> 
> Your muscles running low on energy might feel like “exhaustion.” Too little sleep might be interpreted as “overwhelm.” A lack of positive social interaction might be experienced as “loneliness.” 
> 
> But these emotions are not objective facts. They are concepts built by the mind out of pieces of sensory data, cultural knowledge, and a history of social interactions. Interoception evolved to balance our body budgets. 
> 
> Experiencing emotions is a fortunate (and sometimes unfortunate) side effect.

How does this explain e.g. joy at seeing something beautiful?

> What this means is that a “bad feeling” is not evidence that there is something wrong. It just means you are taxing your body budget.

Also, if you can increase your emotional granularity, it means you can tailor your responses more closely to what is happening around you - and that you can better recreate/avoid the emotion in the future! [[Emotions for emotional granularity]]

Might I want to read more books from ambitious people, to wire myself for ambition?

And books from loving, caring people, to wire myself for strong companionship? 

> the entire experience of emotions relies on our brain’s predictions about what it thinks our body needs.

How does this relate to curiosity and interest? They seem to be intrinsic.
