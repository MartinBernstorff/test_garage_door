# We are never bored of deep novelty
As opposed to [[§Shallow novelty]], where we can become bored pretty quickly if we already have a model which fits it.

It's probably [context dependent](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00043/full#B21). 

This means that I doubt we have a global drive for novelty, and any "satiation" is more of a "crowding out" effect – of cognitive demand and model integration being full (e.g. can't integrate more inputs at this time, need more sleep, can't pattern match) or of running out of time. The implications of this are that:

1. No need to limit novelty if you're not overloaded cognitively
2. Novelty can be maladaptive for external rewards, if it is crowding out activities due to its own attractiveness, and it isn't itself instrumentally valuable
	1. This is more likely for [[§Shallow novelty]]
	2. This is unlikely for [[§Deep Novelty]], except if we have non-novel things to learn that are highly important

But (2) is only a problem if, upon reflection, we think it is a problem.
