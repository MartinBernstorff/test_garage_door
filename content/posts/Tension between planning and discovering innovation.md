# Tension between planning and discovering innovation
Since [[Building requires feedback]], but we can't meaningfully predict which knowledge work is most useful beforehand, there is tension here.

One approach is Andy Matuschak's structured time, but evaluated outcomes. This can be implemented with predictionbook, like [here](https://acesounderglass.com/2020/08/06/predictions-as-a-substitute-for-reviews/).

I fear that this may take much of the joy out of it, though â€“ however, this probably applies most to goal-directed action.

This means that "failing" to obtain a goal doesn't mean that making the decision was a failure, rather, it means that you've gotten valuable information and can incorporate it into further action, making that action more effective in service of your values. This is incredibly valuable!
