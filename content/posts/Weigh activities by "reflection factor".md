# Weigh activities by "reflection factor"?
As a way of leveraging high-reflectivity moments. It could be a multiplication or addition factor added as a higher-level direction to [[Shepherd attention]]. May be redundant, though, as the reflection may stick into my brain anywho.

One framing is: ‘do you want to do more or less of this”.

May want to make it part of [[Add a larger review function]].

Probably want to add exponential decay to these as well.

This can be done at the level of values as well.
