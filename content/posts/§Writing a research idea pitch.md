# §Writing a research idea pitch
It can’t be only an outline, because [[Outlines aren’t taken seriously]]. But it can be the major parts of the outline, written as continuous text.

You want it to be as minimal as possible, so you can [[Quality check at low value]]. What are the minimal constituents of such a pitch?

It needs to argue whether it can change our model of the world ([[Valuable research changes our model of the world]]) and whether it can uncover levers for change ([[Valuable research uncovers levers for change]]). 

That means that it needs to:
* Uncover which which things need to be unknown or true for this data to reduce an important uncertainty ([[Define the problem]])
* Briefly discuss whether this problem is already solved ([[Probe the research problem]])
* Describe what we plan to do to gain more information ([[Shape the research strategy]])
* Check if the strategy is actually viable ([[Probe the research approach]])
* Argue how we’d interpret different outcomes (if the interpretation is the same, it hasn’t made a difference) ([[Learn from outcomes]])

Q. What should a short document outlining a research idea contain?
A. [[Define the problem]], [[Probe the research problem]], [[Shape the research strategy]], [[Probe the research approach]]
