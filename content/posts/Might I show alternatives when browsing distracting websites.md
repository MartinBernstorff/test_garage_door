# Might I show alternatives when browsing distracting websites
E.g. show activities that are rated highly.

I can do this by using LeechBlock to show a website if I visit a distracting website.

What do I want it to show then?

Depends on the purpose of the website; [[Why do I visit twitter]], [[Why do I visit Reddit]].

Basically means that I should show:
1. Opportunities for a short break
2. Opportunities for a long break
3. Novel activities to try
4. (Anything else?)
