# Why do people choose parenthood
For many, there’s an enchantment with the parental role. For parents who don’t regret becoming parents, they’ve often found great meaning in the role - it becomes the answer to the question: What was my life about?

> “But for many—especially those of us who don’t have the imagination or wherewithal to create meaning in unconventional ways—having children is a way to exploit our potential, to give design and purpose to a life”
For me, I think my life can be about something more important to me than that. Something like making a difference for a group with disease. But also caring for a partner, a dog etc.

> “In 1971, for instance, a trio from Harvard observed ninety mother-toddler pairs for five hours and found that on average, mothers gave a command, told their child no, or fielded a request (often “unreasonable” or “in a whining tone”) every three minutes.”
Excerpt From
All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern

> “Hanging out watching videos, having tea, having them spontaneously come over and hug me, being amazed at how good they are at doing things and how little push they need to do what they’re supposed to, and the quiet wonder of just being with them watching them GROW. . . . Listening to my youngest practice a violin etude last night—one he had bored himself silly with all summer—I was just awestruck that this kid who has terrible handwriting, who likes fencing with sticks in the backyard and who will do anything to start a water fight—could make such truly beautiful music.”
Having children is a more intense version of the caring process you have in a relationship. This comes with all the joys, but also all the pains, that you get from that.

Many of the joys are passive, ie. observing your child, so ey often don’t show up in questionnaires. That fits well with life satisfaction as well.

Perhaps having a child is like an amplified version of having a dog. Not the same, but some of the limitless love you felt for Eros and hamlet, but complicated by the humanity of the child, and the intense amount of care it requires.

It can also be about connection, the universal connection with all parents.

Another point is to share a nearly universal human experience. And since children are often remembered far more fondly than they were experienced, it’s also a way of shaping our life story.

They can also be a reason for focusing, for figuring out what this life thing is actally about. A source of meaning, a shot at making the world better for them than it was for you. Your children’s futures become what you live for, and a purpose worth fighting fo.

They can show you more parts of the world, and can generate pride through their a mastery of subjects you know close to nothing about.
