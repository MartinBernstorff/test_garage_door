# Minimising WIP increases efficiency
When we minimise WIP, we make it easier for individuals to stay focused. We have less on our minds that can provide internal context switching, and we have fewer people vying for our attention, decreasing external context switching. This helps [[Balance context switching]]. Having less on our minds also makes it much easier to prioritise, decreasing overhead.

Furthermore, [[WIP decreases flexibility]].  Being more flexible means that the organisation as a whole can move resources around to optimise for a given constraint.

Q. Why does WIP affect efficiency?
A. WIP makes it harder to focus, and more likely to work on low-efficiency tasks because of commitment.
