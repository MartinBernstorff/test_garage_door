# Diagnostic process

# Why?

1. Better decision making
2. Better information collection, and thus better feedback

Which all lead to: Better, faster and more accurate diagnosis. This improves:

1. Patient well-being
2. Spending on health-care
3. Loss of production to illness

Which would enable:

1. Universal coverage (by a strong diagnosis-maker)

## The initial encounter

### Problem identification

#### 1. Information gathering

1. Use computer to collect all relevant data for initial presentation
2. Use computer to generate differential diagnosis based on presentation
3. Use computer to generate potential tests
4. Physician - patient interaction determines which tests to order
5. Restart from 1

#### 2. Problem identification
Should be clearly, unambiguously defined.

Should be written down – how else are we going to learn which inputs truly matter? And how else are we going to properly collaborate physician to physician?

Medical records are not standardized – why not? What is the advantage of non-standardization? Probably makes it easier for humans to read, but do we really want humans to process immense amounts of information? Huge variation doctor-to-doctor, see ref. 84.

### Processing
*Chronology:*

1. 

Genomics and proteomics further underline why this is necessary.

Can't be done by a physician alone – our knowledge is limited and our minds are prone to cognitive biases.

For example, to any patient who sees multiple doctors, it's obvious that there is extreme variance. A symptom of disorder.

And for routine cases, should be manageable by individuals. We don't use path-finders for showing a direction, or engineers for picking cars; why should we need doctors to pick treatments?

Should be systematized in a problem-knowledge coupler.

When expert-knowledge is needed, credentialling should be based on periodic tests of actual competence, not tests of random bits of knowledge.

### Problem solving

#### 1. Planning

#### 2. Follow-through

#### 3. Feedback

#### 4. Corrective action
Should be monitored.

Since people have different preferences, they should choose different treatments. Like people travelling somewhere; if you want to stop at a national park, you shouldn't be forced to abide by the "optimal" route.

Effectiveness is context-specific. We usually study efficiency, not effectiveness.
