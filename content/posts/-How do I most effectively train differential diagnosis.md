# ?How do I most effectively train differential diagnosis
[[§Differential diagnosis]] can, schematically and simplified, by fit into a list of steps:

[[HumanDX]] scores well for [[§Generation (DDX)]] and [[§Pruning (DDX)]], but not for [[§Refinement (DDX)]] - I don’t have to come up with the tests required for further refinement.

* [[§Generation (DDX)]]: Coming up with potential diagnoses
* [[§Pruning (DDX)]]: Removing examples that clearly aren’t a good fit
* [[§Refinement (DDX)]]: Checking for fit/getting more information

Each of these can be trained in different ways, see each subject.
