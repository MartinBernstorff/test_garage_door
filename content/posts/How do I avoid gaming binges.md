# How do I avoid gaming binges?
Auto-ratchet with beeminder? It’s a bit expensive, but gaming binges are incredibly expensive.

However, given the relatively slow feedback loop of Rescuetime -> Beeminder -> Integromat, there’s a high risk of derailing if you auto-ratchet to a level low enough to avoid binges (eg. 2.5 hours). 

I might still want to try this out, but for now, let’s see how it goes without it.
