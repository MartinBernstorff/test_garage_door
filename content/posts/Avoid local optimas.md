# Avoid local optimas
[[Feedback can push you to local optima]], since it induces [[Hill climbing]]. 

To escape the local maximum, we need to look for new ideas and continue with them, even though they looked less promising (jitter), or starting from scratch with new ideas (random-restart), or adding a probability of making what we expect to be poorer decisions (the Metropolis algorithm). 

For more on this, "simulated annealing" in [[Algorithms to Live By]]. #perusable
