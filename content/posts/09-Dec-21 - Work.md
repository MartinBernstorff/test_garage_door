# 09-Dec-21 - Work
*How am I feeling today?*
Very good! Ready to get work done! Very much ready to make progress on LPR2-LPR3.

A little worried about being sent home, but will have to make the best of that if it happens. 

* [[§Diagnosestabilitet på tværs af LPR2->LPR3]]
	- Make a list of which results to report
	- Add p-values to those results

- Work on some pain points ([[49-21 - Work]]).

* Misc. reminders
