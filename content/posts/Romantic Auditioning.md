##Purpose and Principles

The purpose of auditioning is:

*1. To evaluate my current partner*


*2. To sharpen my relationship skills and to start building the foundation of a strong relationship*
Different women are going to have different preferences, but some are constant. Since honest conversations about relationships are rare, experiencing a multiplicity of them allows me to sample what they're like, and to take the best from all of them to build a relationship that's worth treasuring.

## Outcome visioning
The barrier for entry is higher, and I'm looking for the best partner I've been with so far. When I find someone who's better than anyone previous, and who's above my quality minimum, I dedicate myself entirely to her.

# Which Partner is Right for Me?
A partner I'm likely to stay with

A partner I'm likely to be happy with.

## A Secure Base
Children explore more when their parents are around. The same goes for adults – they dare take more chances if they have a secure base in loving relationships. Partners who aren't a secure base are detrimental, but those who do make life uch better.

### Do I need to share life goals with my partner?
[[Share values with your partner]]
Probably yes, at least enough so that we respect each other and don't get in each other's way.

However, as or even more important is that we provide each other with a secure base. If we do so, we amplify our mutual effectiveness. As long as our purpose vectors are pointing somewhat in the same direction, the increase in effectiveness is probably worth it.

# Foundation building

## Communication
Communicate openly, compassionately and unapologetically. That's secure and confident, and it sets the standard for how you expect your partner to communicate as well.

This way of communicating is, by far, the most effective way of weeding out incompatible partners and attracting compatible ones. It may break people up, but only if they weren't compatible in the first place. It allows you to gather as much data as possible, and to decide whether your current partner is worth the effort to accept the inevitable differences between you.

In general, my attachment style is probably somewhat avoidant. When I need time alone in general, I should communicate that I need it, and that it has nothing to do with the specific person – that I need it from any and all of my relationships.

When a partner raises an emotional concern, give it space and try to understand how you can meet the need that the concern is coming from.

### Texting
If a subject is emotionally charged, try hard not to do it via text. Firstly, if the text is incoherent with current level of intimacy, it signals fear of rejection and neediness. Secondly, it introduces temporal randomness into responses, further drawing out suffering. Thirdly, it removes non-verbal communication, dramatically increasing the risk of miscommunication.

* [[When do I want to initiate auditioning in dating]]
	* This is an [[Optimal stopping]] problem for [[Romantic Auditioning]].
* [[§Why I date]]
	* 1. *Exploration*: I date a lot of women, and my barrier for entry is low. I focus a lot on getting to know my preferences better, while also sharpening my flirtation and getting comfortable around women. I probably have a couple of one night stands, simply to know what they're about, and if they're something for me. I do this for around 4/10ths of the time alotted to dating.
3. *Fusion*: A monogamous relationship where we're both dedicated to each other and to a higher purpose.
