# How will I handle meaningless work?
There are probably multiple approaches:
1. Try to have it removed, to make working life better
2. Move through it as quickly as possible, to avoid struggle

1) is a better solution when possible, and it can help make the world better for people other than youself! As a question of morality, thatâ€™s probably the superior option.
