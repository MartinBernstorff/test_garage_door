# Avoid laziness
Laziness is being stingy with effort; it's avoiding expending effort. 

This typically leads to missing out on enjoyment, missing out on meaning and missing out on being useful. It stands in direct contrast with [[§Nobility]]. 

I fear that using the terminology in daily life is dangerous, as it's highly judgemental in the current cultural climate.
