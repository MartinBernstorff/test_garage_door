# Cognitive defusion
The opposite of [[Cognitive fusion]].

* Thoughts are merely sounds, words, stories or bits of language.
* Thoughts may or may not be true; we don’t automatically believe them.
* Thoughts may or may not be important; we pay attention only if they’re helpful.
* Thoughts are definitely not orders; we certainly don’t have to obey them.
* Thoughts may or may not be wise; we don’t automatically follow their advice.
* Thoughts are never threats; even the most negative of thoughts is not deeply disturbing or frightening.

Q. What is the purpose of [[Cognitive defusion]]? 
A. To make space to your thoughts, to see them for what they are – an interpretation. *Not* to get rid of them.

Q. Imagine a situation where you're having an unhelpful thought. How do you want to handle it?

	* Q. What is the purpose of [[Cognitive defusion]]? 
* [[Thought and feeling control strategies]]
	* Remember that [[Thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems]]. To avoid this, [[Strategies for using thought and feeling control strategies]] or consider [[Cognitive defusion]].
* [[Make room for your feelings when they become unhelpful]]
	* It's a practise of non-reactivity. Just like [[Cognitive defusion]] requires that we focus on our thoughts to practise it, so does [[Expansion]]. But we're working towards needing it less and less, to let the emotions be and go do something meaningful.
* [[Struggling with emotions spawns more struggle]]
	* Now, the goal isn't to stop judging our emotions – that's highly unlikely to happen. The goal is to practise [[Cognitive defusion]] from our emotions, and then letting them be – because even though emotions can be unpleasant, does it help you to fuse wit the thought that it's awful/terrible?
* [[Defuse from your thoughts when they become unhelpful]]
	* [[We largely control how we respond to thoughts]], and this makes for a massive difference! [[Thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems]], but there are alternatives – eg. [[Cognitive defusion]] allows us to let the story be while taking action on something we value.
* [[Lack of knowledge of values can be due to experiential avoidance]]
	* If we encounter people that we estimate might be like this, it's essential to work with [[Cognitive defusion]] and [[Make room for your feelings when they become unhelpful]] first.
