# ABZ for my future
# Plan A 
*Work:* Do something interesting for work (research, high-level medicine).

*Social life:* You have interesting, compassionate friends and family that you meet up with for dinner parties, social activities, eating out, board games. You help forge new connections with people that ultimately make the world a better place; be that by making happy, fulfilling relationships, or facilitating alliances or collaborations that spark progress.

You have pets, e.g. a dog, that moves around with you. You also have a girlfriend who's intelligent, motivated, compassionate, but doesn't need children of her own.

*Altruism:* You make the world better through earning to give and/or through your work. 

# Plan B
*Work:* Do something interesting for work (research, high-level medicine).

*Social life:* You have interesting, compassionate friends and family that you meet up with for dinner parties, social activities, eating out, board games. You have pets, e.g. a dog, that moves around with you. You have switching partners depending on where you live, with whom you develop loving, caring relationships for as long as they last. You don't want children, but that means that your relationships are often more transient.

 *Altruism:* You make the world better through earning to give and/or through your work. 

# Plan Z
*Work:* You do something interesting but less complicated, e.g. become a GP or a hospitalist.

*Social life:* You have compassionate friends and family that you meet up with for dinner parties, play dates and holidays. You might have pets, e.g. a dog, but only after your children have grown up. You have children, a boy and a girl,  which fatigue you, annoy you and take up most of your time â€“ but which are also quite rewarding.

 *Altruism:* You make the world better through earning to give and/or through your work.
