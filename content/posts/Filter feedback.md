# Filter feedback
This means it’s incredibly important to [[Set up the right feedback loops]]. It's one of the components of [[Go for efficient feedback]].

	* [[Filter feedback]], and that means to often do experiments. But also do your best to get useful feedback;
* [[Use practice as the bar for truth]]
	* Things can be true without being obvious in practice (statins), and they can seem true in practice without being true (eg. homeopathy). Using practice as the bar for truth is not fool-proof, and it can be overturned by stronger types of evidence. [[Filter feedback]].
	* How, then, do we apply this? Well, use [[Believe-ability]] to [[Filter feedback]]. And take action on much of what you learn. Not only does it give you feedback, also [[Action makes knowledge useful]]. 
* [[Get exclusively high validity feedback]]
	* Since [[Feedback guides focus]], getting non-valid feedback means we'll focus on and try to improve things that don't matter. This means that we need to [[Filter feedback]], to avoid focusing on the wrong things.
* [[Believe-ability]]
	* Use this to [[Filter feedback]].
* [[Feedback competes]]
	* Since [[Attention is limited]] and  [[Goal competition]], feedback competes. This makes it incredibly important to [[Filter feedback]].
