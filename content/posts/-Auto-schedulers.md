# $Auto-schedulers
There are multiple advantages of auto-schedulers :
* [[Auto-schedulers remove cognitive overhead from calendar constraints]]
* [[Quantifying workload motivates you by showing your potential]]
* [[Auto-scheduling makes limitations obvious]]
* [[Auto-schedulers keep tasks salient]]

However, there are also disadvantages.
* [[Scheduling makes activities seem more like work]], probably through [[Auto-scheduling decreases satisfaction of autonomy]]. Can be somewhat circumvented by [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]]. Rough scheduling (eg. at a day or rough section of day level) implies that I can decide not to do something or in which order to pursue activites.
	* An important caveat is that [[Scheduling doesn't decrease enjoyment of unenjoyable tasks]]

One further worry is that [[Scheduling decreases serendipity]].

[[Auto-scheduling limits analysis paralysis]], almost entirely eliminating it if you're relying on a specific schedule. But that's mostly because I haven't yet internalized that [[$Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]].

The decrease in options comes from considering hard deadlines, one of the exceptions to [[$Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]].

For comparing specific apps, see [[How does SkedPal vs. TimeHero affect my emotional response to completing tasks]].

## Backlinks
* [[§Executing well]]
	* If scheduling is high overhead, use [[$Auto-schedulers]].
* [[Do you want to use an auto-scheduler for work]]
	* Most of the arguments in [[$Auto-schedulers]] apply to this question as well, especially given that work is affected by many of the exceptions to [[$Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]], eg.
