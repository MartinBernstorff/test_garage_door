# Shape research ideas
This is prototyping for research ideas ([[Why do we prototype?]]). It consists of:

* [[Define the research problem]]
* [[Shape the research strategy]]

It’s a separate track from production itself, and it's also separate from scooping full articles. You want to have one or more excellent ideas in each article.
