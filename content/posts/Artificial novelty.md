# Artificial novelty
Artificial novelty circumvents [[Novelty is a signal of information]].

Artificial novelty is novelty that is generated (eg. games) or where the information is highly selected from a distribution (eg. news).

This argument is fleshed out more in Black Swan #research

This has negative consequences. [[Artificial novelty distorts our view of the world]] and [[Artificial novelty makes us more neurotic]]

## Backlinks
* [[Novelty is a signal of information]]
	* However, in the present world much of the novelty we encounter is highly biased [[Artificial novelty]], or it is novelty that doesn't relate to reality at all.
* [[Artificial novelty distracts from true exploration]]
	* When we want to build something great, we often don't know what that is or how to get there. Then we can't do objective based search, we must do [[Â§Novelty search]]. However, it is severely hampered by [[Artificial novelty]], eg. news.
	* If our sense for novelty is satisfied by constant [[Artificial novelty]], we'll never encounter new information (in the sense of improving our understanding of the world), and given that [[Building requires feedback]], we'll never improve.
