# Meaningness
Things can have meaning, be meaningless, or nebulously in between. Like something can be a cloud, not a cloud, or undefinable (think a cloud's edges).

We have to live as if meaningness is nebulous, whether it truly is or not, because that's the state at which our understanding is.

Meaning is created in the interaction between individual opinion, social interaction and culture. If either condition isn’t there, it’s very hard for meaning to arise.
