# Focus on purpose when writing todos
When phrasing "to-dos", it almost never matters what the actual activity is. E.g. "write a rough draft of a manuscript" is lifeless, technocratic, dull-minded. It is an instruction for a computer, not for a person. 

People want to find meaning. Instead, phrase the purpose – "Communicate XYZ ideas so that we can explore them together". 

Q. Why might atomic todos like "write rough draft of the manuscript" be problematic?
A. It is an instruction for a computer, not for a person. 

Q. How might we imbue a to-do like "write rough draft of the manuscript" with meaning? 
A. Do it at a meta-level, like "communicate this idea so we can be curious together".
