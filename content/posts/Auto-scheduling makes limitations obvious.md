Furthermore, it highlights trade-offs â€“ given XY (current dedicated bandwidth, deadlines etc.), this task will complete on Z time.

This is incredibly useful! It makes it obvious that you should either take on fewer things, or increase bandwidth for a given project. Beware that there are more considerations though, like [[Auto-scheduling decreases satisfaction of autonomy]].

	* Secondly, since [[Auto-scheduling makes limitations obvious]], it moves the decisions up one level of abstraction. Rather than deciding exactly which task to do right now, you have to decide your priorities; which projects matter most to me right now, given my constraints? However, this doesn't mean that it is actually perceived as satisfying autonomy, though. (For more, see CET).
