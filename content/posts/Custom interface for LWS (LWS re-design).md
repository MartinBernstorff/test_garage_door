# Custom interface for LWS (LWS re-design)
- Design
	- Bread-boarding
	- Wire-framing (pencil)
- Programming
	- Tech-stack decisions
	- MVP of easy-select
	- Expand featureset

The primary advantage is that I'll be able to:
1. Select rejuvenating activities, without thinking too much about it
	1. Given that I'm often in a low-energy state when making these decisions, that means it should be near-effortless to get to the app â€“ implying that mobile compatibility is probably a first class citizen
2. Make the relevant elements of feedback much more obvious and styled
	1. E.g. if you're selecting activities that typically get poor ratings, you can highlight that at the point of making a decision

This suggests a range of screens and affordances:

## Item selection
When selecting activities, we should highlight:
1. How often that activity has been gauged as a "good choice"
2. The typical goals of that activity
	1. If the activity has a poor rating, maybe alternatives that share similar goals?

1. Manual input screen
	1. Input field (text based)
	2. Search results (live?)
2. Easy-select screen
	1. Perhaps with filters
		1. By duration
		2. By value
		3. By goal
		4. By ideal energy level
	2. Presents N activities at a time and allows you to select them
		1. One at a time? (Tinder like)
		2. Multiple at a time, to allow for comparison?

## Item curation
3. Currently selected items screen, to allow for:
	1. Total duration estimation
	2. Re-ordering 
	3. Completion/overview
