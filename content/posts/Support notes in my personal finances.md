# Support notes in my personal finances
An improvement to [[§My personal finances]]. I have plenty of expenses where I can’t categorise them based on where the expense was incurred – eg. Mieke’s dad’s gift from Føtex, dagligvarer vs. Candy etc.

I’d like to get a better handle on how much I spend on snacks. 

This can be solved via 
+ shows up next to them when I’m categorising. 
+ input from google forms that matches poster with a given date
+ Add support for multiple inputs on the same day
+ I also want to add the input to my phone via a shortcut to make it easy to do.
