# Freedom, not forcing
In a sense this is about [[Effortlessness]].

Good use of [[§My systems]] seems like being liberated; it externalises an obligation so you don't have to worry about it. It doesn't seem constricting – it's someone helping you out, not someone forcing you to stay on task.

Nobody/nothing else can bother me.”


[[Better systems miss the point, what we want is better action]]
