# Meaningness: Participation
We are neither completely separate nor completely connected. We are individuals with connections to each other; this blends the boundary between who 'I' am and what 'we' are. This means that we are, to some extent, all responsible for each other.

A good example is blueberry jam.

Another is that there are cases when parts of us are more connected to others than ourselves. For example, when someone falls in love against their better judgement, they're more connected to their other person than their own dispassionate thoughts.
