# ?JIT task switching
E.g. [[Productivity - Sam Altman]], and SÃ¸ren Dinesen, recommend using internal indicators for when to switch tasks or take a break. This is so alien to me! But maybe it leads us to the most pleasant life states over time? 

Given that our heuristics for [[Relevance Realisation]] seem to be pretty good most of the time, this seems like a good approach.

What might the downsides be?
* Going too deep into a problem, without thinking about it. Externalising the breaks is good for solving this, but also means you self-monitor less.

* Overdone context-switching, e.g. on computer. Can be mitigated by getting a better context.
