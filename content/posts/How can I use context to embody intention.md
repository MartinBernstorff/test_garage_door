# How can I use context to embody intention
* [[Home is lack of intention]], [[Intention as context]]
Which intentions are best suited for doing at home? Defaulting to automatic beahaviors, hosting events, sleep, sex. Nothing much else, really!

Home is a place where automaticity takes the front seat, and typically not in a good way - it’s typically gaming or lying on the couch watching a youtube video.

Which places do I have available for context switching?

* Coffee shops (at e.g. Trøjborg). While somewhat expensive, still super cheap given the amount of productive work you can get done!

* Library
	* Statsbib

* University
	* Nobel
	* If that dries out, VAB?

* Coworking spaces

* [[Use your commute to plan and reflect]]

## Backlinks
* [[8-Dec-2021 - Review]]
	* There are very few things that I need (or want) to get done at home which require it. Most productive things on the computer I’d much prefer to get done in a different context ([[How can I use context to embody intention]], [[Intention as context]]).
* [[Low friction environment-change]]
	* ([[How can I use context to embody intention]])
