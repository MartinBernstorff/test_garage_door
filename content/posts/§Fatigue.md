# Â§Fatigue
I think there are multiple types of fatigue, which are all essentially a signal that doing something else is expected to be more useful than what you're currently doing.

/Neurological/
* [[Cognitive load fatigues us]]
* [[Emotional load fatigues us]]

/Psychological/
* Fatigue by low [[Motivational intensity]]
* Mediated by lack of BPN-satisfaction [[BPNT]]

/Physical needs not being met/
* Fatigue by sleep pressure
* Fatigue by hunger/dehydration

#### Common mechanisms that haven't been supported
* [[Fatigue by lack of willpower]]
* Fatigue by focus depletion
