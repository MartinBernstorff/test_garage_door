# How do I want my arousal to vary during the day
[[Arousal helps us take action]]. Therefore, I want arousal when it is useful, likely when I have a hard time getting started. That means relatively high in the morning, moderate to low during the day, and then low/high depending on how I feel in the evening.

Q. What is your ideal circadian arousal-rhythm?
A. High in the morning, moderate during the day, low or high in the evening depending on activities.

[[Arousal is required for intense experience]], so I don't want to avoid arousal completely in my leisure time.
