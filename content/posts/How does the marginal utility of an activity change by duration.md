# How does the marginal utility of an activity change by duration
Probably decreases dramatically, differes by activity. E.g. the last 5 minutes in the shower are not nearly as good as the first 5.

For some activities, this goes for cost as well, but that is more complicated. The first 5 minutes are costly, then the next X minutes are low cost, and then the cost starts to increase.

This has implications for how often to task switch.
