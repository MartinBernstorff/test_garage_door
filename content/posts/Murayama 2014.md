An overview of [[Retrieval Induced Forgetting (RIFO)]]. Typical paradigm is to learn a set of items based on taxonomical (and sometimes + stem) cues, then be tested on those items as well as other known items.

E.g. learned item: `fruit: or____`, non-learned item `fruit: ba____`.

Typical effect size /g/ of 0,5, 0,3 if adjusting for “output interference”, e.g. the fact that recalling the cued items first might interfere with recollection of the non-cued items.

	* Probably! The paradigm in [[Murayama 2014]] is “produce elements from cue”, which matches “question” - “list” quite well.
