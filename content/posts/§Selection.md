# §Selection
Consists of a simpler problem, how to choose the things that matter rather than those that don’t, and a tougher problem, how to choose the things that matter most among opportunities that are all interesting.

This reduces it to a [[§Sorting]] problem. 

In the ideal world, find all the options you could do, then sort.

In reality, probably bucket-sort into “things I’d regret not doing”, and “things I won’t do” ([[§Regret Minimisation]]).

	* What to do at all? [[§Selection]].
	* Maybe this isn’t quite right, though? [[Impact Density Scheduling]] uses the importance of a task to sort them for execution, somewhat similarly to [[§Selection]]. However, [[§Selection]] is a [[Bucket Sort]], so it might improve the overall efficiency anyway.

	* Q. In your terminology, which sub-problems does [[§Prioritisation]] consist of?
