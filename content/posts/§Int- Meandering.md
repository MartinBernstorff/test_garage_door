# §Int. Meandering
[[Why Meander]]

Meandering is looking around, skimming on the surface of different materials, looking for where to dive deep. This is distinctly different from [[§Int. Reading]], in that it’s about prioritising, rather than learning.

It often feels a little bit like learning, though, and that’s dangerous! Your retention from it is often *very* low.

Most of my reading goes through a funnel; but the thing is, I’m the person taking care of every step of that funnel. This means that time spent at the top of the funnel is time I cannot spend reading. It’s an [[Explore or Exploit problem]] - one where I'm still uncertain about when to commit. For now, using my gut is yielding pretty good results, so let's stick with that!
