	* While we can control the outer world relatively well (/fix the roof if the water is dripping on you, work more hours to get better pay, [[We largely control what we do]]/), [[We have limited control over what we think]] and [[We have limited control over what we feel]]. The extent to which you believe this can be scored with the [[Control of Thoughts and Feelings Questionnaire]].
