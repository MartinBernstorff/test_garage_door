# Research questions around NSS
Do I want to focus on MHC or NSS? Probably NSS, as I think that MHC is a grouping that is still somewhat arbitrary, and most likely not the grouping with the most information. One question arises, then:
* [[Is it useful to group NSS]]?

* [[What is the causal mechanism for NSS]]?
* [[Are adolescents with NSS in need of more interventions?]]
* [[How do doctors interpret NSS?]]
