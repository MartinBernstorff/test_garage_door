# Life is too short for highly engaging displacement activities
# Highly engaging activities aren’t great for resting
The qualifier "highly engaging" is key. If activities are relatively low engagement, they help you to marinate on your life and its problems, and promp a state [[§Boredom]]. This can, in itself, promote the state we're looking for.

One example of this, [[Life is too short for gaming alone]].
