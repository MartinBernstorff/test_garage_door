# Balance context switching
You should minimise context-switching at the minute to an hour level, but have moderate switching at the hour+ level. This allows you to work on novel, interesting things (increasing performance) while avoiding most of the waste of context switching:

> The moral is that you should try to stay on a single task as long as possible without decreasing your responsiveness below the minimum acceptable limit.

[[Even though context switching decreases efficiency, it most likely increases effectiveness by increasing total output]]

Another way of phrasing it is to do "slow motion multitasking".

One of the reasons is [[Task switching leaves attention residue]], [[Task switching erodes focus]].

One way to operationalise this is to 
* [[Balance WIP]], for example using [[§Kanban]] or, if there are multiple steps, [[Theory of Constraints]].
* Decrease the cost of context-switching ([[?How can I decrease the cost of my most frequent context switches]])
* Set a hard limit on minimum duration of a “chunk” of focus, in effect setting a max limit on number of context switches

Can we dynamically set interrupt-allowances? Like for chats - if it’s been less than N minutes since last message, deliver notification immediately, otherwise wait until next batch?

Q. Why might we want to decrease context switching at the scale of minutes?
A. [[Task switching leaves attention residue]], [[Task switching erodes focus]]

Q. Why might context-switching be beneficial at the timescale of hours? 
A. It keeps things interesting

* [[Balance WIP]]
	* It is essentially about [[Balance context switching]].
* [[§Scheduling for a single agent]]
	* However, this is costly due to [[§Context Switching]] ([[Balance context switching]]). When, then, should we switch? I think when the increase in impact (time · density) is larger than the cost of the context-switch. Can we make that into a heuristic?

* [[Avoid inboxes]]
	* Inboxes make it difficult to [[Balance context switching]], since they tend to make you browse more information than what you need.
	* Q. Why might we want to decrease use of inboxes?
* [[§Batching]]
	* [[Balance context switching]]
* [[Minimising WIP increases efficiency]]
	* When we minimise WIP, we make it easier for individuals to stay focused. We have less on our minds that can provide internal context switching, and we have fewer people vying for our attention, decreasing external context switching. This helps [[Balance context switching]]. Having less on our minds also makes it much easier to prioritise, decreasing overhead.
* [[Keep planning and execution separated]]
	* This helps [[Balance context switching]] as well as to keep duration estimates independent from current psychological state, maintaining [[Informational process goals are motivating]].
* [[Taskheat vs TimeHero]]
	* Really all I can import into TimeHero is the name, duration, start and due date and assignee. This creates tons of problems for a potential import; if I update all tasks, I’ll have to update dependencies all the time. If I update only the actionable tasks, I’ll switch between paths all the time, running into problems with [[Balance context switching]].
* [[§Context Switching]]
	* [[Balance context switching]]
* [[01-Jan-22 - Homely]]
	* Might run into problems with [[Balance context switching]], depending on the size of each item
* [[How might I set up my computer for slow motion multitasking]]
	* Eg. to [[Balance context switching]]. One way is to have a specific account for consumption, eg. Twitter/Facebook/Email.
