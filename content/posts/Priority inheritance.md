# Priority inheritance

## Backlinks
* [[§Scheduling for a single agent]]
	* [[Priority inheritance]] - if a task is low-priority, but required for a higher-importance task to get done, it should inherit the importance of that task. E.g. if you need to clean your room to have your friends over, cleaning your room becomes high priority! This is essentially what we mean when something is instrumental ([[Instrumental Values]]).
* [[§Scheduling algorithms for a single agent]]
	* [[§Procrastination]] can be seen as a strategy to [[Close open loops]] – you do the small tasks first, so you can get them off your mind. Another, better method is probably to just let the task be, if it isn’t ever going to the top of [[Impact Density Scheduling]] - either through pure density or [[Priority inheritance]]
