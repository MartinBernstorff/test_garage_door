# §Efficiency Paradox
For some tasks, getting more work done in less time doesn’t lead you to more leisure time - it leads to more tasks available.

One especially salient example is email; the faster your replies, the more likely people are to write you.

That’s not necessarily a problem, though! As long as the work we do is valuable, getting more of it done is good. 

However, if we feel hurried and busy, the cure is rarely higher efficiency. It’s turning down opportunities and responsibilities, as well as accepting imperfection. It’s all about [[§Prioritisation]].

Also known as [[The Efficiency Trap (use The Efficiency Paradox)]].
