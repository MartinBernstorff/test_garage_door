# Beware maximisation
One of the reasons this often goes wrong is because the measure is tied to compensation (whether monetary or self worth) and typically something you maximise. This means that you'll keep pushing for improvements, even when improvements aren't possible or desirable (eg. working more hours or being busier). Instead, for most measures a "desired" interval is probably what you're looking for, eg. "work between 25 and 40 hours a week".
