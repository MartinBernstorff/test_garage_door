# Shepherd attention
[[Attention is zero-sum]] and [[Attention is limited]], so to live a life of meaning we must [[Govern attention]]. 

This is split into [[Protect attention]] and [[Direct attention]].

## Backlinks
* [[Attention is zero-sum]]
	* This means to expend attention where it *matters*, and to minimise attention where it doesn't ([[Shepherd attention]]). A huge part of why we pay money to have chores taken care of is not only to save time, but largely to [[Protect attention]] ([[Spend money to protect attention]]).
* [[Add a larger review function]]
	* To effectively [[Shepherd attention]], we need to leverage the moments of high reflectivity that we have, e.g. with [[§Incremental thinking]]. 
* [[§Attention]]
	* [[Shepherd attention]]
* [[Spend attention well]]
	* To get this done, remember to [[Shepherd attention]].
* [[Weigh activities by "reflection factor"?]]
	* As a way of leveraging high-reflectivity moments. It could be a multiplication or addition factor added as a higher-level direction to [[Shepherd attention]]. May be redundant, though, as the reflection may stick into my brain anywho.
