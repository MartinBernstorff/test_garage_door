Since we all have a near endless list of preferences and idiosyncrasies, finding a partner that suits us perfectly is unlikely.

Further, we change over time, and [[We change more than we expect]], so being compatible over long stretches of time is highly unlikely.

However, this doesn't mean that there aren't degrees of compatability. Some people are just naturally more optimistic, calm and easygoing [[Emotional stability predicts relationship satisfaction]]. Some people are better at communicating, and some people have similar interests.
