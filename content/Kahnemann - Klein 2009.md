[[Naturalistic decision making (NDM)]] happens by intuitively generating one option, simulating whether it’ll work, if not generating a new option or adapting the previous option for fit.

Heuristics can be problematic in medical contexts, see [[Croskerry and Norman 2008]].

Those in the heuristics tradition ([[Kahnemann]] compare decisions to the optimal decision, in the naturalistic decision making they compare to those who are regarded as skilled in the domain.

Heuristics researchers focus on heuristics that have arisen spontaneously, whereas [[Naturalistic decision making (NDM)]])researchers are especially interested in heuristics that arise from skill practice and experience.

Since we need to make thousands of decisions and [[Heuristics increase speed of decision making]] and [[Heuristics are low effort]], training heuristics is probably worthwhile for problems of low leverage and high frequency.

For intuitive skill to arise, we need a high-validity environment and sufficient practice.

One example of non-regular environments is strategic, economic and political – eg. [[Tetlock 2005]].

[[Prediction is often not enough]].


Q. How might intuition be fooled by wicked environments?
A. Reverse causality, self-fulfilling prophecies.

Q. What constitutes a wicked environment? (Hogarth)
A. It facilitates wrongful intuitions; eg. due to self-fulfilling prophecies.
