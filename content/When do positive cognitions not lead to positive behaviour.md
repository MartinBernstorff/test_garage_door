# When do positive cognitions not lead to positive behaviour?
By “positive” behaviour I mean behaviour that is adaptive for the organism. It’s another way of phrasing “when do we have good intentions, but don’t act on them”.

1. If the intention isn’t integrated 
2. If we don’t set goals
3. If we seek social approval, but don’t actually want to take action
4. If we forget
	1.  If we become distracted by behaviour that isn’t positive, but appears positive ([[Fast positive but delayed negative feedback fosters compulsion]]).
