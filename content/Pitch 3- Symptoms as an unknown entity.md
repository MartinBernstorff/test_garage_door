# Pitch 3: Symptoms as an unknown entity
Self-reported symptoms in clinical practice are much different than the  symptom-reporting in the general population. Traditionally, some symptoms have in clinical practice been perceived as “somatic”, whereas others have been perceived as “mental”.

However, little is known as to whether symptoms in the general population:
* Are closely associated (cross-correlation matrix) - har jeg lavet, men ikke output
* Should be described as one, two or more dimensions (PCA) - har jeg lavet, men ikke output
* Are mostly associated to somatic or psychiatric diagnoses (faceted diagrams as we have made) - har jeg lavet
* Cluster together (k-means clustering) - har jeg lavet

To describe non-specific health complaints in the general population, we undertake the above analyses.
