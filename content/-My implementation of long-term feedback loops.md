# $My implementation of long-term feedback loops
Prediction markets is one solution, but input is relatively slow and sluggish. May want to roll my own solution in my notes instead, and then import that via an API. 

To operationalise this:
* Setup the hash-tag extractor
* Setup a new base
* Setup email sending

<!-- #life/project/1. rare# #service/work-shapeable -->

Make sure that whichever implementation you make of this respects [[Get feedback that supports BPN]].

Examples:
<!-- #learn Migrating to Bear for notes was worth it. 02/02/2020.  -->
<!-- #learn Trying out hardball was a good decision. 04/02/2020. -->

<!-- {BearID:18BF2372-5D5F-414E-B653-B0034DEC4EB7-5627-0000037F56CF5226} -->
