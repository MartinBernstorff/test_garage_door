# §Guide novelty search
When exploring, you want to increase the [[§Deep Novelty]]-to-noise ratio. This can be done in many ways, some thoughts: [[Increase novelty-to-noise ratio]].

Q. What are advantages of guiding exploration?
A. It removes noisy sources, and it allows for specialisation – making it exploration for society, rather than just exploration for you.

Guide exploration:
* [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]]
* [[Guiding exploration is necessary due to infinite paths]]

General principles:
* [[Exploration is about learning]]
* [[Exploration is searching for novelty]]

Actionable advice:
* [[Balance exploration and specialisation]]
	* [[Avoid shallow novelty]]
	* [[Remember what you've explored]]
* [[Practical reasons should guide exploration]]

	* We also want a system that allows us to algorithmically [[§Guide novelty search]]. Most things are a lot more fun if you get good at them, and [[Building requires repeated attention]]. But intuition needs to be fed ([[Building requires feedback]]), and it needs to have salient options ([[Motivation is increased by salience]], [[Keep your values salient]]).

	* This is an argument for [[§Guide novelty search]] and somewhat [[Balance exploration and specialisation]], but probably more in the minutes-hours scale than days-years. [[Facialisparese]].

	* However, we want to [[§Guide novelty search]] since [[Building requires repeated attention]], essentially to [[Balance exploration and specialisation]].

	* And so it is with luck — unlucky people miss chance opportunities because they are too focused on looking for something else.
