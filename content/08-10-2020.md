Today I’d like to do some thinking on [[Test quickly for writing]], which is part of [[Quality check at low value]]. 

I’d also like to go through [[Turn scientific productivity into something actionable]].

For learning, I’d like to read more of Shape Up, to figure out how it applies to my shaping of article ideas, and how it ties into the hill chart in the early, exploratory phases. #perusable

I also fear that I don’t have a good method for getting ideas shaped up.
