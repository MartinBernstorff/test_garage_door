# Alerts for time-sensitive actions
I want to use [[§Rough scheduling]] most of the time because [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]]. 

For coordination though, we sometimes need precise scheduling. To close that open loop, I need a robust, reliable system for being alerted to when specific tasks/events need to happen. 

For now, the best solution is setting alarms manually on my iPhone.

### Rejected
One solution is to be able to set start times in Airtable, and then have those sync to my calendar. My calendar then handles the reminders. However, this isn't robust as the calendar reminder is just a notification – it doesn't keep ringing if I don't turn it off.

- Setup Airtable -> Calendar sync
- Set more robust calendar alerts (can I force sound on iOS?)
