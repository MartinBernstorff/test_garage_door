# PhD planer
This is a sub-section [[$Career-planning]].

*Define the problem*
I’m somewhat bored and under-stimulated, I cannot get started on getting a pet before I have relative stability, and I don’t know what’s next for me right now.

*Shape the strategy*
This means getting into a specialty or academic position relatively quickly after finishing KBU. I can do that most effectively if I already have a PhD lined up.

To look at how I can use my skills in science to make the world better, and that means either:
* Exploring which PhD opportunities are available. It is the story of the explorer, looking for the next adventure. Or: 
* Developing a PhD opportunity within an area that you can make a difference in

How might I do this most strategically? It’s going to be easier to hitch onto someone who is already on a roll, so to speak, so looking for those as a first step seems a good idea.

Probably ask Bodil first. It has been a ton of fun and freedom to work with her and the group, but I do worry that the research will be of too little impact. The best way of exploring that is to see if there’s a project that I think is high impact, and which I can do with them.

While doing that, start exploring other avenues. Write Daniel Witte, the fertility guy, KEA and any other places you might consider – probably including the other people at section for epidemiology.

Also look into how this fits into my previous career-plan notes.

*Probe the approach*
How might I test the above? Are there assumptions I’m making that might fail?
