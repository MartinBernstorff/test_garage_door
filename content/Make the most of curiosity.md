# Make the most of curiosity
The vision here is that I spend most of my time on the most important types of curiosity, and that I have a relatively easy time sitting down and either:
* Pull up the stuff I was thinking about, or
* Find something interesting to read, or

When manifesting intellectual curiosity, there are three distinct activities that I do (in the order of more to less focused, and probably also in the order of more to less valued):
1. [[§Deliberation]]
2. [[§Int. Implementation]]
3. [[§Int. Reading]]
	1. [["Better reading" misses the point; what matters is better decision-making]]
4. [[§Int. Directed Search]]
5. [[§Int. Meandering]] - this is similar to [[§Novelty search]], and might very well be best shaped by something like [[Mailbrew]] ([[?Mailbrew is net helpful]]).

To retain curiosity and playfulness, we want the shaping to be of an *extremely* light touch! Having utility pop up should happen very rarely, and should ideally be reserved for meta-thinking like this document.

* [[§Curiosity]]
	* [[§Curiosity]] solves problems in two ways, [[§Novelty search]] and helping realise a [[§Vision]]. This makes it incredibly important, while also being tremendously fun and meaningful. Therefor, it makes sense to [[Make the most of curiosity]], and one of the best ways of doing that is to [[Let curiosity guide you]].
* [[Prioritise reading over meandering when the material is good]]
	* Firstly, this is about shaping intuition! It must be extremely subtle; we want to [[Make the most of curiosity]], and that only works if you [[Protect curiosity]]. 
* [[The Next Chapter of Readwise]]
	* Can this help me [[Make the most of curiosity]]. This depends to a large extent on:
