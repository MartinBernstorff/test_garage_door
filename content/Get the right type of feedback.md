# Get the right type of feedback
The desired type of feedback strongly depends on the task. For optimisation style tasks, you want feedback on your solution quality. Beware of deception if you’re strongly interested in the global optimum [[Novelty search with constraints is probably the best option if we're facing objectives with deception]].

For exploration style tasks, you instead want more feedback on the novelty of your attempt (or the interestingness).
