# Connect around debate
I think part of the reason that I like to debate is that it highlights my skill. That is, in some sense, selfish. 

However, I also like to debate because it allows me and the person I'm talking to to express our deepest beliefs. Knowing what someone else believes, especially if I know how strongly they believe it, helps me understand who they are. 

If I also know why they believe things, that helps me figure out to which extent I can take what they think and say at face value. The better their argumentation is, the less I have to validate it.

In some sense, that is one of my challenges with Mieke ([[Mieke dislikes debate]]).
