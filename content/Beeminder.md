# Beeminder

## Backlinks
* [[Do I want as intense hedonism as possible]]
	* Since [[MIL is fun]] and I have decent mechanisms for adjusting overrun ([[Complice.co]], [[Beeminder]]), does this imply to make those as enjoyable as possible as well? Eg. [[Do I want to play FPS games]]? 
* [[Quantified weekly review]]
	* This has been replaced with [[Beeminder]], which fulfilled "[[Do sufficient maintenance]]".
* [[Â§My execution system for recreation]]
	* [[Do sufficient maintenance]] - [[Beeminder]]
* [[Tools for feedback - to implement using systems thinking]]
	* [[My: Percentile feedback]]
[[Complice.co]]
* [[Find a solution to replace beeminder]]
	* [[Beeminder]]
* [[Loving-kindness meditation as a routine]]
	* Instead, I could add it to [[Beeminder]] as a weekly thing.
