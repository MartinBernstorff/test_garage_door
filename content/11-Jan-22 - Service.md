*How am I feeling?*
Pretty good! A little overwhelmed again, but makes sense to just take some time every once in a while to relax. E.g. going for a long walk seems like it might be indicated soon.

Also makes sense ot strongly evaluate which things are relevant! 

That said, things are going great! Interesting, motivating projects that are likely to imporve my future. Very nice!
