# How would my PhD be different from my research year if I continue with non-specific symptoms
What I have been doing so far has been to help define the problem. However, for non-specific symptoms, an open question is whether they represent something that we don’t already know is there. 

Most likely, they’re a weird combination of:
* How the children relate to their bodily signals
* The different generators of bodily signals
