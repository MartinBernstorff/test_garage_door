# ?Memorise lists for medicine
I did for the exams, but do I now? 

It would definitely be helpful to be able to produce all differential diagnoses off the top of my head, but I don’t think that’s feasible. It’s simply too hard to memorise that amount of information.

?It might also not be how I use the information in real life. Typically there’s context prompting it.  

For diagnosis, this probably holds. But for interventions, I’m less sure - e.g. which interventions I have available for handling upper airways.
