# Is MHC a useful conceptualisation
For MHC to be a useful conceptualisation, it must be somewhat like [[Â§A proper diagnosis]].

I believe that [[MHC can be of benefit to the patient]] and
[[MHC is likely valid]].

I'm in doubt about its "incremental validity"; whether MHC captures something that our current diagnostic system does not.

We have shown that, after adjusting for known diagnoses, MHC is still predictive of hospital contacts and medication use. But is that because MHC is predictive of future diagnoses? Ie. is there any reason MHC should be its own concept? [[Is MHC separate from known diseases]].
