# Promote serendipity
One explanation may be that serendipity doesn't arise unless your life is exposed to some degree of randomness, eg. meeting new people, trying new activities, learning new skills.

Another is to allow your mind to chase rabbits down rabbit holes, eg. by doing an hour of writing each morning.

You can schedule these activities, but I worry slightly that [[Scheduling makes activities seem more like work]].

In essence, this is a question about [[How to change behaviour]]. Most methods are likely to be able to yield the same result, but with different psychological qualities.
