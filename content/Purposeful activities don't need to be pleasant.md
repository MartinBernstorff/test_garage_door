# Purposeful activities don't need to be pleasant
I might also believe that if I don't desire to do work, it's because I need more time for recreation.

This is obviously not true, some parts of work just aren't desirable. Rather than waiting for that desire to arise, it's important remember what I'm fighting for. If an activity is laced with purpose, it doesn't matter that it isn't pleasant.

If possible, [[Align emotions and cognitions]], but sometimes it isn't. And oftentimes, we do errors of affective forecasting, so we overestimate the affective loss of doing the work.
