# How do I get co-authorships?
Part of my series on [[§Scientific Productivity]], [[Working well with others determines scientific productivity]], [[$Improving career prospects as a scientist]].

In general, we invite people to be co-authors if they’re contributing something to the project or to us. This means that I need to build up skills that someone would like to have on their paper.

This can be:
* Coming up with the idea and managing the project
* Domain competence (unlikely for me to be competitive in that for a while)
* Execution competence
	1. Programming
		1. Analyses
		2. Data-management
	2. Statistics
	3. Helping with writing

- Does this model fit with Bodil/Dortes/Others model?
	If yes, which can I improve? #service/Meeting/Bodil
