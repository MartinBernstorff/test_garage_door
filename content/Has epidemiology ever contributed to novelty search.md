# Has epidemiology ever contributed to novelty search
Ie. has exploration via epidemiology ever yielded new actionable insights?

It definitely has! Eg. smoking. Even though unmeasured confounding couldn’t be ruled out, it turned out to be true – randomised trials on smoking cessation showed that it decreases mortality. 

The question is more open re: topics where causal models are likely more complicated – eg. whether it has expanded the [[Adjacent possible]], especially in areas where we don’t have strong causal hypotheses.
