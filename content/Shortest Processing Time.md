# Shortest Processing Time

## Backlinks
* [[§Scheduling algorithms for a single agent]]
	* [[Shortest Processing Time]]: Do the smallest projects first. 
* [[Stress and queues]]
	* Does stress happen when we’re queued too deep? When we feel we must maximise throughput of items ([[Shortest Processing Time]]), rather than [[Impact Density Scheduling]]? Or when we’re worried there will be dire consequences if we don’t get everything done?
