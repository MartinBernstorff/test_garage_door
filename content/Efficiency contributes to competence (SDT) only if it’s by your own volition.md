# Efficiency contributes to competence (SDT) only if it’s by your own volition
Being efficient typically requires coordination, lack of exploration, planning. 

If that is forced, rather than autonomous, then high levels of efficiency becomes a source of pain. We might misconstrue that to mean that searching for efficiency causes the suffering – but that is unlikely to be the case. 

However, efficiency is never the goal; it is merely the length of our stride towards what lights the spark of our passion.
