# Keyword mnemonics are of low utility
Q. What is the procedure for using keyword mnemonics?
A. Find a proxy that sounds like the word, then make an action with that proxy that explains the word.

Q. What is a paradoxical effect of using keyword mnemonics?
A. They can accelerate encoding, but also forgetting.

Q. When are keyword mnemonics useful?
A. If you need to retain the information for hours to a day and can't write it down (ie. rarely).

> This possibility was supported by data from Wang et al. (1992; see also Wang & Thomas, 1995), who administered immediate and delayed tests to different groups of students. As shown in Figure 4 (top panel), for participants who received the immediate test, the keyword-mnemonic group outper- formed a rote-repetition control group. By contrast, this bene- fit vanished for participants who received only the delayed test. Even more telling, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 4, when the researchers equated the performance of the two groups on the immediate test (by giving the rote-repetition group more practice), performance on the delayed test was significantly better for the rote-repetition group than for the keyword-mnemonic group (Wang et al., 1992).
