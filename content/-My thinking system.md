# $My thinking system
The core principles behind this system are found in [[§Principles for improving thinking]].

I [[Run note scripts once a day]].

The workflow depends on when a new idea is generated. If it's generated in context, it can easily be added. But if it's salient during something else, it has to be ingested in something inbox-like ([[How do I best handle the continuing stream of inklings]]).

[[Nudge towards repeated effort in ideation]]. ##### TX:

While it is true that [[Randomness promotes serendipity]], I get sufficient randomness from my daily life, and it's reflected in my new prompts. [[Notes should resurface to prompt new connections]], but I want to strongly [[Temper randomness to maintain signal]], so I touch one random note every 5 Obsidian launches. ##### TX:

#### Small things
##### TX: Disable older scripts
##### TX: Move most notes to the same folder

#### Open issues
* I feel like I'm not sufficiently focused on engaging with the same notes, eg. that I'm not sufficiently living by [[Building requires repeated attention]].
	* I have more new writing prompts than I know what to do with. [[How do I best handle the continuing stream of inklings]].
	* My new notes are often not promoted, so I don't naturally gravitate towards what I'm currently building upon.
		* It's the balance between allowing older notes to perservere, while keeping newever notes at the surface. A temporary #p method for this is definitely great, maybe even tiered.
		* Because new notes often sprout from a branch, they are a sort of repeated effort. I want to promote this. [[Nudge towards repeated effort in ideation]]
* I also want to spend more time reflecting in my notes, something like, leading to a question like [[How do I balance think-research-read-do-experience]]
* [[Do I want to promote notes that haven't been developed yet]]
