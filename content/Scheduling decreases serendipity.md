# Scheduling decreases serendipity
One of my concerns is that having things scheduled, eg. filling up my day, gives me less free time to be serendipitous. Especially if I'm suppressing interesting rabbit-holes for more structured pursuits.

However, absolute freedom as it stands now is obviously not a good alternative either. I end up spending a lot of time on watching TV and gaming, rather than exploring which other options might be available.

The fact that I don't explore well by default doesn't mean that scheduling is the solution, though.

It's an interesting question to ponder, [[How do I increase exploration]] and [[Promote serendipity]].
