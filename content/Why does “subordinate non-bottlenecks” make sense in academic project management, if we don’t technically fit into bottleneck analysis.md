# Why does “subordinate non-bottlenecks” make sense in academic project management, if we don’t technically fit into bottleneck analysis?
[[Subordinate non-bottlenecks]]

It makes sense in that subordinating to eg. my advisors is going to make the flow of even a single item go faster, since they’re the primary delay in calendar time for that item. 

At the level of the system they are a bottleneck, because they have other items coming through, and those items take precedence. 

To improve the speed at which my coauthors reply, make the work easy for them to do, make the perceived priority high and make them do as little work as possible.
