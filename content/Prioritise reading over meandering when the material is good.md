# Prioritise reading over meandering when the material is good
Firstly, this is about shaping intuition! It must be extremely subtle; we want to [[Make the most of curiosity]], and that only works if you [[Protect curiosity]]. 

Browsing/exploring media can be seen as an [[Explore or Exploit problem]]. We are choosing between a) selecting an item from the reading list or b) going to the internet to find material.

In that sense, we can use the [[§Multi-Armed Bandit Problem]] algorithm; keep "exploiting" (going to the reading list) for as long as that seems interesting, fun, and you don't regret it. As it starts to grow stale, switch more of your attention towards finding new material.

Q. How might you prioritise between reading and meandering?
A. It's an [[Explore or Exploit problem]]. As long as your reading list offers up interesting articles with [[§Deep Novelty]], the less often you should look for new media.

Q. Why might you choose [[§Int. Reading]] over [[§Int. Meandering]]?
A. It helps you to a) inform your future meandering with the knowledge gained and b) learn more (less time wasted in overhead).
