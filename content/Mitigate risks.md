# Mitigate risks
Imagine the strategy has failed. How did it do so? (Eg. a [[Premortem]]).

Which unanswered questions or rabbit holes can become a problem. How can we amend the solution to avoid them? 

Which uncertainties can you decrease, eg. by [[Quality check at low value]]?

Are there technical challenges you need to ask a subject matter expert about? Are they doable within your appetite? Which risks do they see? Try to “keep the clay wet” - present it in a way that explains the idea but shows that it is very flexible, eg. a whiteboard.

Specifically mark things out of bounds if there’s some area that’s enticing, but will increase project duration dramatically.

Can you [[Decrease dependencies]]? Will the recipient understand the point you’re trying to make? Now is the time to [[Quality check at low value]].

Also, cut back the solution. Decrease the scope.
