# Online dating strategy
My limiting factor/bottleneck is, currently, most likely to be the amount of dates I go on before settling down – rather than finding dates to go on.

This means that I want to balance:
1. Filtering for high quality, relationship potential dates while also
2. Having fun, chatting women up and going on dates at the pace I want

So far, this means that I can filter a little harder. The best place for doing that right now is in real life as well as happn.

If I want to have more conversations, or more fun, non-serious dates, Tinder can supplement. 

But I want to be up front; on the third date at the latest, I’ll talk about what I’m looking for with the woman I’m with. This avoids hurting them, as well was myself (like what happened with Simone/stærkstrømsingeniør).

One possible routine for Happn could be:

1. 20 swipes
2. Write the 3 most interesting accounts

And then supplement with Tinder to the amount you desire.
