*How am I feeling today?*
Feeling pretty good, or damn near awesome! Energised, well-rested, had fun at work, can imagine an awesome future with data-science and with Pernille. Life is good!

Yes, there are risks, but those are manageable, and you can’t visualise a better future without it ending up disappointing you. I think the key is to imagine something that is grounded in possibility, and then re-imagine it as you get more information.

Today/tonight is all about having fun with Pernille, learning more about her, and checking if you guys are a good fit (in that order).

*Plan*
* Cook risotto
* Tidy and clean
* Pakke stikdåse til Lasse
* Skrive rundt med sociale events
* Pernille
* Bestille deodorant
