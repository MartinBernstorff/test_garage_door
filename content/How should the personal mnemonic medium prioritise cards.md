# How should the personal mnemonic medium prioritise cards
For medicine, there are lists of facts that I *need* to know.

For the [[§The Personal Mnemonic Medium (general concept)]], most of what I add is interesting and useful, but not required. Since [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], having a fixed amount of work (that piles up) to do is not the most helpful.

Instead, you want it to be flexible. You're not going for an objective, you're practicing. This means setting a default limit on how many cards to do, and setting a sensible prioritisation algorithm for selecting those cards.

Since [[Building requires repeated attention]], one way of prioritising may be to select the cards that are the least over-due. This will narrow your focus.

This runs the risk of letting important, profound cards sink to the bottom forever – interspersing it with random selections seems to counter this, but I don't know if that's possible with the algorithms in Hoochiemama/papa.
