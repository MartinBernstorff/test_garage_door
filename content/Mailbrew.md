# Mailbrew
A tool for batching information for easier processing and browsing, eg. Reddit, Twitter etc.

For [[§Int. Meandering]], Mailbrew helps me batch it and keep a constant trickle of little interesting tidbits in the afternoon daily. 

For things that I'd prefer not to miss (but that are not time sensitive), I add them to the meaty Saturdays.

For things that are time sensitive and I'd prefer not to miss, I add them to the mornings.
