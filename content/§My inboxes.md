### Rapid if conversation

Response times for email are somewhat complicated – sometimes there's a conversation that you need to have (e.g. what are we going to do about transport to Odense), and that conversation is easier if response times are quick, and quicker reponse times means closing the loop faster.

However, with the kind of activities that I'm currently in charge of, daily is more than enough. 

I can then add anyting that requires faster than daily responses (FB Messenger, DBA, gmail in special circumstances) to my "distraction phone", and then deliberately have that on me during special times. This marks a clear separation between when I'm in "distracted" mode and in focused mode.

Which alternatives are there for handling conversations? Are these feasible?
