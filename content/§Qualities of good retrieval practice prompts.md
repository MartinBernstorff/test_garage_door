# §Qualities of good retrieval practice prompts
What are the criteria for a good characteristic in a prompt?
* The information shows up in consciousness when you need it (and doesn't when you don't)
* They are efficient to review
* They are engaging to review 

Good prompts are like good diagnostic tests - the phrasing triggers the card in situations with a high PPV and NPV for the knowledge being relevance. 

For some knowledge, there just are very few situations where you can have high PPV and NPV, because the knowledge is so general. In those cases, you might have to keep the phrasing somewhat general, and maybe include some examples?

Otoh, best practice programming is super easy - include an antipattern, then your brain will overwrite over time.

One argument for allowing [[?Retrieval prompts should include (only) the context available at usage time]] to be downplayed is that we allow the brain to make these connections. It's all about transfer learning, though, [[Practice how you play]]

Some areas of exploration:
* [[How do we trade off difficulty of creating cards and the benefits of having them]]
* [[How do we balance card difficulty]]

* [[Antipatterns in Retrieval Practice]]
* [[Examples in Retrieval Practice]]

* [[?When do I want to use cloze deletions]]

* [[?Decrease lack of consistency in 12th sem. retrieval prompts]]

*Mechanics*
* [[Retrieval prompts should usually focus on one idea]]
* [[Retrieval prompts should permit only one answer]]
	* [[Expert response heuristic]]
* [[Retrieval prompts should be narrow in scope]]
* [[Retrieval prompts should encode ideas from multiple angles]]
	* [[Retrieval prompts should connect and relate ideas]]
		* [[Avoid orphan retrieval prompts]]
 
*Subjective Qualities*
* [[Retrieval prompts should be effortful]]
* [[Retrieval prompts should ensure reviewers must retrieve answers from memory]]

### Meta
* [[Spaced repetition is about changing yourself]]

### Heuristics
* [[Expert response heuristic]]
* [[Student Heuristic]]
