# Are NSS associated with outcomes in ways that are not face valid
If NSS are associated with outcomes in a counter-intuitive way, or all symptoms are associated with roughly the same diseases, they don’t just represent well-understood disease; they represent something else.

Eg. if the somatic scale is associated with psychiatric diagnoses, then we know that it doesn’t just represent somatic complaints. And vice versa. This is interesting! Especially at a population level.

This can be something like “non-specific symptoms and non-specific outcomes – an exploration into the grey area of the hospital system”.

Further questions are [[Pitch: Are NSS associated with Z- or R-diagnoses]].

* [[Pitch: Which diagnoses are the different NSS symptoms associated with?]].
