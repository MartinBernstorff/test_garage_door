# Oscillation
Which factors increase risk of system oscillation?
1. Narrow range
2. Delay in feedback
3. High power of response
4. Bang-bang response (non-proportional)
5. Acting on noise

This happens when the action initiated in the previous step makes the signal cross the opposite end of the range, triggering an opposite strong response.
