# Do I want to pitch at the research idea or paper level?
In the spirit of [[Quality check at low value]], I want to pitch research ideas to a few select people. 

When they reach the stage of combining into a paper, you probably want to pitch again â€“ firstly to validate the research approach, secondly to validate that co-authors see connections between the ideas.
