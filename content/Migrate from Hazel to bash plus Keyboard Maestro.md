# Migrate from Hazel to bash plus Keyboard Maestro
Hazel to shell-scripts, launched when launching and re-launching obsidian.

Currently, there's a jarring feeling since making something a priority with p1, or adding a $Note, also means that the note will disappear whenever Hazel runs.

Instead, make a script that automatically moves the files, but only run that script whenever Obsidian is launched.
