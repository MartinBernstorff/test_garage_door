# Cognitive fusion
Cognitive fusion is the blending of a thought (story) and an event.

We perceive thoughts to be reality, true, important, orders (we automatically obey them), wise (that they know what's best) and can be threats (actually hurt us).

Furthermore, [[Cognitive fusion is not the enemy]].
