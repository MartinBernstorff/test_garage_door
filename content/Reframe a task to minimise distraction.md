Instead of running away from your pain, try to pay close attention to your task and find new small challenges you didn’t see before. 

> “People find fun in a wide range of activities that you might not find particularly interesting. Consider my local coffee-obsessed barista who spends a ridiculous amount of time refining the perfect brew.

> The car buff who toils for countless hours fine-tuning his ride or the crafter who painstakingly produces intriquette sweaters and quilts for everyone she knows.

> If people can have fun doing these activities by choice, what’s so crazy about bringing the same kind of mindset to other tasks?”

Make it more fun and treat it like a game. 

A task becomes more fun when you try to find the variablity. 

Break through the boredom and monotony to discover its hidden beauty.
