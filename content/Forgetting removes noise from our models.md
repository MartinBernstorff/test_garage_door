# Forgetting removes noise from our models
https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3271

Essentially, the more noise you have added to the model, the less efficient (and probaly precise) it will be.

This may be one of the reasons we forget; memories are reinforced the more we encounter them, letting non-important information (noise) dissipate.
