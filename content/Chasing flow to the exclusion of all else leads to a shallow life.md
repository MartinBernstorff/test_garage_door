# Chasing flow to the exclusion of all else leads to a shallow life
You may end up missing out on the experiences; savouring where you are, tasting the food and feeling the hug. In flow, you loose track of time – in mindfulness, you stretch time as much as possible.

That said, flow is also a state that leads to large accomplishments and tends to unlock doors that you want to go through. 

This is inspired by [[Soul (Disney)]].

Q. Why might flow need to be counterbalanced with mindfulness?
A. In flow, you loose track of time, and you need to feel like you have time to relax.

	* I thoroughly enjoy this sensation, it adds zest to my life. But I’m also reminded of a lesson from [[Soul (Disney)]]: If you spend your entire life in flow, you miss out on savouring the flavours of life ([[Chasing flow to the exclusion of all else leads to a shallow life]]).
