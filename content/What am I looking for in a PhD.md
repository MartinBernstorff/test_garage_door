# What am I looking for in a PhD
My ideal PhD:

The problem
	* [[MIP helps make the world a better place]] 
		* [[MIP comes with DALY improvement]] or [[MIP is novelty search]]
A proxy for how useful it is:
	* [[MIP is neglected]]

For personal career:
	* [[MIP allows me to learn useful things]]
		* [[MIP allows transferable skills]]
	* [[MIP signals my competence when completed]]
	* [[MIP is in a good environment for my career]]

And for thriving:
	* [[MIP is interesting]]
	* [[MIP is something I’d be good at]]

This essentially means that it can be in any of the steps highlighted in [[§Problem solving]]. [[How would my PhD be different from my research year if I continue with non-specific symptoms]].
