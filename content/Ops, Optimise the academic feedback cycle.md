# Ops, Optimise the academic feedback cycle
To have the manuscript ready as quickly as possible, basically work hard and fast [[Working well on problems determines scientific productivity]].

![[Hold only necessary meetings]]

![[Reduce lag due to co-author labour time]]

![[Reduce lag due to full calendars]]

To make it easy for co-authors to give feedback:

1. {Track changes as you modify the document, and as you're about to share it, accept all changes that you don't need feedback on}
2. {Make it clear why you need feedback on which section, and the impact you think it'll have}
3. {Write in the email to them which sections you expect feedback on, and from whom}
