# My ideal partner is a functionalist
In the sense that she doesn't care much about furnishings and things for purely aesthetic reasons, but she cares about solving functions and having it look OK while doing so.

This means that my ideal partner is robust and somewhat of a minimalist. She cares about functional comforts, and aesthetics to some extent, but spends little time and energy optimising them – she's easily satisfied.
