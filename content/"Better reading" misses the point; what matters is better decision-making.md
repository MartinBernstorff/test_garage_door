# "Better reading" misses the point; what matters is better decision-making
We read to learn ([[Deep Novelty]]), and we learn to make better decisions ([[§Decision making]]). When we have more prior causal knowledge, we are more likely to be able to affect the world around us. This is what decision-making is all about.

In that sense,  we don't care about how much we read, how much we write, or how much we think. We care about getting better at making decisions; the above activities are in service of that.
