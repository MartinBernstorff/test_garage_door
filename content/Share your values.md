# Share your values
Since [[Vulnerability is required for caring]], it’s pertinent that you share what you value and what you care about to those you want to build deeper relationships with.

As the sentence states, that does make you somewhat vulnerable – some people might judge you or try to hurt you for what you believe in. However, your self-confidence is relatively high, and you’ve gotten much better at sharing what you believe without being confrontational, so you can probably share much more than you do.
