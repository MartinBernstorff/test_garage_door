# Balance exploration and specialisation
Q. Why do we want to balance specialisation and exploration?
A. The ideal is to build strong domain competence so that you can do novel work, but dedicating time to explore broadly so that you can take insights from other fields to further advance your own.

	* Allow ideas I’m working on to stay on top (especially if they’re somehow “immunised”, like adding a “working on” tag that is removed only if pressing “next”), avoiding spreading myself too thin idea-wise ([[Building requires repeated attention]], [[Balance exploration and specialisation]])
