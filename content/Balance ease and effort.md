# Balance ease and effort
It is easier to play computer games than a board game night. It is easier to spend a month at home than to go travel. It is easier to rent than to own a home. 

But all of these latter alternatives are also, to some, much more meaningful. They lead to fuller lives. This leads to an adage, “An easy life is an unfulfilled life”. If most of your days are filled with easy activities, it’s time to reassess!

You still want your life to be as easy as possible. Struggle isn’t valuable in itself - when you struggle, look for new opportunities! Select the ones that are high leverage! But then put your effort towards them. Balance ease with effort, never straying too far into either.
