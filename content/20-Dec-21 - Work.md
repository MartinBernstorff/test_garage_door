# 20-Dec-21 - Work
*How am I feeling today?*
Pretty good! It's very nice that we can work at the same physical location, makes for a huge difference in motivation for me. Also makes it much easier to set the right context.

Had a great time with Pernille yesterday, awesome stuff, nothing much to change. She's fun to talk with, and we're starting to tease each other in a fun way as well. Maybe limit it slightly, to keep a romantic rather than friendly atmosphere, unsure.

Ready to, at a rather slow pace, get some work done. 

- Clean workspace

- Find monitors

[[Log: Clairvoyance tutorial]]
* Setup Clairvoyance on ucloud
	- Clone from the git
	- Upload a .zip with the data 
	- Move and unzip
	- Add h5py to requirements

* Modify temporal data
	* Variables
		- sales_family
		- sales_family2
	* It appears there's a bunch of missing values, what gives?
		- E.g. for a given date, id combination, some values don't exist

* Check performance
	- Categorisation instead of regression
	- Time might have to be numerical

* Lav figur 1 til manuscript-artikel (tag udgangspunkt i poster-figur)
