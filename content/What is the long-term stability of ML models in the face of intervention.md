# What is the long-term stability of ML models in the face of intervention?

[[Batched or incremental-live learning for ML-predictions]]

If we have interventions that effectively prevent the outcome from happening, all predictors will trend towards 0. 

That is problematic if we don't internalise the causal structure in the healthcare system â€“ i.e. if the only reason we intervened on a variable is because it was predictive. 

However, if treatment is merely augmented by prediction (and adapts to learn from the new predictors), extinguishing those as predictors won't result in worse treatment.
