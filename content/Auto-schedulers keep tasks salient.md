# Auto-schedulers keep tasks salient
You know those tasks that you've been adding to your "someday" file, but you're not getting around to doing?

Some of that is that [[Motivation is increased by salience]], and having the task buried deep in a folder you don't review means that the tasks aren't salient.

Auto-schedulers fixes this. When there's room in your calendar, it makes a suggestion that an activity can be suitably completed on that day.

For things you aren't committed to, it's often a good idea to make use of an [[Idea-system]] to avoid it feeling like an obligation.
