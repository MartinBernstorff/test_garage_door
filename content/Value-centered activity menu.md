# Value-centered activity menu
+ Mark selected values
+ Those values are marked on Airtable
+ That gives a bonus on activity menu, and automatically marks them as “show in menu = 1”
+ Then we press a button, and it renders the activity menu below the values (render component on button press)
+ Marked values are reset daily with automation
