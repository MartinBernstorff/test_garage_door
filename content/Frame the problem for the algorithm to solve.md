# Frame the problem for the algorithm to solve
What is the objective (function), i.e. what makes this solution useful?

How will the solution be used?

What are the current solutions or workarounds (the benchmark/baseline to beat)?

Should the solution be:
	1. Supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning
	2. Classification, regression or something else?
	3. Batch or online learning?

What is the best performance measure (to be aligned with the objective)?

What is the minimum performance required to declare “success”?

Are there comparable problems where we can reuse experience or tools?

Which assumptions have we made so far, and can we verify them?
