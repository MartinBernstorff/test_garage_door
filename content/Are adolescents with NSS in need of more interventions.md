The hypothesis is that children with many non-specific complaints have longer diagnostic workups and don't end up with a diagnosis. If MHC reflects FSS-like symptoms, we'll see that the children  in the upper quartile have

Ie. what the different diagnosis-patterns for quartiles of contacts are (especially ER)?

<!-- #service/research-idea This means that the children with severe impairment should relatively rapidly show up in hospital, have more hospital contacts, get a diagnosis if appropriate, and then have an appropriate amount of hospital contacts for that diagnosis. -->

[[Is the MHC flow in hospital generally appropriate]]

The children with low impairment should have a low amount of hospital contacts, and quickly fade out. Is this the case?
