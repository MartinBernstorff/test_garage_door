*How am I feeling today?*
OK. A little worried about [[§My Relationship with Pernille]]. Perhaps it doesn’t suit me terribly well, at least my intuition tells me so, and that’s something I’ll need to handle.

It most likely has something to do with how I engage in conversation. I rarely bring up the things that truly interest me, and that’s a shame! Especially with Pernille, that is something I’ll have to practice more of, because most times I do it, it ends up being very interesting! And, no matter which partner I end up with, I want to be able to cultivate interesting conversations!
