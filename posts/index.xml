Re: Pernille, getting really affectionate with her! Only 2 concerns; don&amp;rsquo;t want to become a platonic friend (unlikely based on the type of kissing right now), and a tiny bit worried that our sexual needs differ. This last part is something it makes sense to talk about at some point, especially if we&amp;rsquo;re not getting sexual soon.
For work, just very excited! A great future appears to lie ahead, especially if I sharpen my data science skills.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/02-11-2021.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/02-11-2021.html</guid><description>02/11/2021 Foreslå dato til at arbejde med Mathias</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/02-12-2021-home.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/02-12-2021-home.html</guid><description>02/12/2021 - Home Finde ud af nytår?

I might have [[§Liking]] without [[§Wanting]] for parenthood. Evolutionarily, we might&amp;rsquo;ve been optimised for wanting sex, since that was enough for parenthood – and then the [[§Liking]] steps in when the child is born.

Pretty good! Excited about the prospect of planning at different timelines! Especially since I can make a “stack” of it, which’ll might allow me this type of long-term thinking without promoting too much [[§Staleness (productivity)]].
Ask Pernille about whether she can see herself living at Vestervang. If not, it probably doesn’t make sense to purchase it.
Even if I don’t end up being with Pernille, I don’t see myself living alone in 4 years time - and if she’s not game for living there, my future partner likely isn’t either.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/05-10-2020.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/05-10-2020.html</guid><description>05/10/2020 The [[Taskheat vs TimeHero]] problem is going to make a huge difference I think.

Why Be Productive? “Do not squander time, for that’s the stuff life’s made of.” – Benjamin Franklin Ultimately, managing our time is a means to an end. And that end is the living of life. How we spend our time is, quite literally, how we are living our life.
Productivity in itself serves no purpose. In some sense, it&amp;rsquo;s a hobby, a meta-skill, a tool; it isn&amp;rsquo;t inherently meaningful in itself.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/10-10-2021.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/10-10-2021.html</guid><description>10/10/2021 Ted Lasso Tidy Rooms New recipe for slow cooker The Primer Goal reflection Look at “the shallows” and compare to [[§Shallow novelty]].

A little uncertain about Pernille and I; when I was tired yesterday, she didn&amp;rsquo;t grab ta my hints of going home. She&amp;rsquo;s also relatively interested in pretty usual things. That is not a t all a red flag, though. Keep your mind open and give it a shot :-)

OK. A little worried about [[§My Relationship with Pernille]]. Perhaps it doesn’t suit me terribly well, at least my intuition tells me so, and that’s something I’ll need to handle.
It most likely has something to do with how I engage in conversation. I rarely bring up the things that truly interest me, and that’s a shame!

My life is definitely getting better! I&amp;rsquo;m finding people to work with that love what they do, and that look for projects that&amp;rsquo;ll make the world a meaningfully better place.

In which ways is [[§Effective Altruism]] similar to [[§Communism]]? E.g. central-planning, utility-maximisation etc. And what does this imply about the endeavour?

I had a very good time yesterday, especially with the data science books. Just a few regrets: I displayed overly masculine behaviour at Broca&amp;rsquo;s bar, especially when I was doing push-ups and I did to the drop-down dancing bit that&amp;rsquo;s hard on my knees.
Also, the benefits of getting truly drunk are very slim. The drawbacks, are very real.

This ties into [[Look into the rest-weighted hour]], to better gauge task-importance in [[Impact Density Scheduling]]. The &amp;ldquo;duration&amp;rdquo; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be duration per se, it should be the effort-adjusted hour. A 10-minute google search didn&amp;rsquo;t reveal it, though, so there&amp;rsquo;s a challenge in finding it.

Gmail filters send important email to a label called “Temp Inbox” and the rest to a label called “Unimportant.” I check Temp Inbox each evening and Unimportant once a week. Since incoming email doesn’t go to the inbox, I can open Gmail to compose or search messages without getting distracted by unread messages.

Physics progressed when physicists wanted to understand the natural laws of the universe and not because physicists wanted to make stuff that&amp;rsquo;s useful.

Many of the arguments against summaries go away with thorough processing. Summaries are said not to change behavior as well, bu that can be somewhat remedied with the personal mnemonic medium. Summaries are said to not give as thorough and understanding, but if you do your own thinking, you not only understand the arguments - you integrate them into your model of the world.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/2020-09-19-10-22-01.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/2020-09-19-10-22-01.html</guid><description>2020-09-19 10.22.01 How do I ensure that I encounter my source notes, if I encounter same source again?</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/2020-09-19-10-24-05.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/2020-09-19-10-24-05.html</guid><description>2020-09-19 10.24.05 Clear iPad tabs daily?</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/2020-09-24-21-16-26.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/2020-09-24-21-16-26.html</guid><description>2020-09-24 21.16.26 Batch information for better processing

A little distracted from the mechanical keyboard. Not terribly important, though.
It appears it takes more force than expected, and that might make me more fatigued in my hands over the day. OTOH, that might be healthy.
This is also what will contribute to the keyboard having fewer missed strokes; you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to have glances, rather than presses.
It just feels like home, in some sense, even though you have to type harder to get what you want.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/21-11-2021-home.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/21-11-2021-home.html</guid><description>21/11/2021 - Home Personal hygiene

Right now, I really don&amp;rsquo;t feel like becoming a parent. But when I imagine the future, a future with children appears as desirable (albeit more heavy and complicated) than having just a dog.

Being ambivalent isn&amp;rsquo;t a sign you definitely don&amp;rsquo;t want a child, either.

Decreasing the frequency to once every 2 weeks appears a good idea, and then more ad-hoc meetings as required. The advantage of regular meetings is primarily in time-savings in scheduling, but this is decreased by Søren often rescheduling.

Might have COVID, so that’s not ideal. Other than that, would love to see some people, to have some around me. That’s what I need most and, ironically, what I can’t do. Getting an early test tomorrow is the best way of changing that.
Right now, I’m reaping the benefits of changing contexts. I need to take that very seriously, as it makes the difference between a day near-wasted gaming etc.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/26-dec-21.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/26-dec-21.html</guid><description>26-Dec-21 -</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/260820.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/260820.html</guid><description>260820 Being a parent will bring with it adventures, but of a much different kind.

I think I could still be happy if we had a child, but I think I could be even happier if I found someone like Mieke, who didn&amp;rsquo;t want children.

Probably yes.
If it was the same without a wife? Then it&amp;rsquo;s a coin-toss.

The major issue was running down [[§Rabbit Holes (attention)]], especially when using my computer in the sofa.

Phenomenologically, it seems there are important caveats to this.
Firstly, some autonomy can be re-introduced by the auto-scheduler not imposing a specific time, eg. [[Rough scheduling increases autonomy]].
Secondly, since [[Auto-scheduling makes limitations obvious]], it moves the decisions up one level of abstraction.

[[Writing forces sharper understanding]], Dan Luu argues you should work on sharpening your thinking rather than slowing down to the speed of writing. This seems true, but doesn’t consider lack of short term memory, nor the effort required to encode an argument into long term memory ([[§Personal Mnemonic Medium]]). Nor does it allow knowledge work to accrete.
One of his arguments is that we need to linearise thoughts – this applies much less to a personal knowledge system.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/danielsen-review.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/danielsen-review.html</guid><description>Danielsen review /Predictive/counterfactually predictive/ Hvorfor justerer de for confoundere, når de ikke mener det er causal inference.
Strongly agree that you should not adjust for a descendant of the exposure that affects the outcome (e.g. a mediator) if you’re doing causal inference.
“The variables that are adjusted for, were chosen as they are regarded as potential true confounders and hence not a consequence of the exposure.”

Flow requires that the activity is challenging, but not too difficult. In that sense, [[Proficiency enables flow]]. If we become more competent at a task, we can reach flow with it.
But difficulty ([[§Difficulty]]) becomes more salient as task difficulty increases. When difficulty arises, that task may already be at too high a difficulty for flow.

Flow is experienced when current projected utility of task is very high, resulting in very little time spent evaluating alternatives.
This matches neatly with the flow criteria:
A clear set of goals and progress – makes the utility salient Clear and immediate feedback – makes the utility salient, also see here. Perceived challenge and skills must match – if there&amp;rsquo;s a mismatch, either skills are underutilized making room for a task of greater marginal utility, or the challenge is too great, decreasing the chance of success.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/fluourescin.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/fluourescin.html</guid><description>Fluourescin Backlinks [[Det røde øje]] QG.

Essentially, the more noise you have added to the model, the less efficient (and probaly precise) it will be.
This may be one of the reasons we forget; memories are reinforced the more we encounter them, letting non-important information (noise) dissipate.

Describe the algorithm of gradient boosting A. 1) Fit a regression, 2) Calculate residuals and use as labels, 3) Append new regression on residuals
Q. Describe the different purposes of boosting vs. bagging A. Bagging reduces overfit, boosting reduces underfit
Q. How does gradient boosting reduce underfit? A. It shapes the model by regressing on residuals

This is supported by Gobina 2015.
When I say endpoints, I mean medication use and hospital contacts.

Like something can be a cloud, not a cloud, or undefinable (think a cloud&amp;rsquo;s edges).
We have to live as if meaningness is nebulous, whether it truly is or not, because that&amp;rsquo;s the state at which our understanding is.
Meaning is created in the interaction between individual opinion, social interaction and culture. If either condition isn’t there, it’s very hard for meaning to arise.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/measure-time-well-spent-with-reporter.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/measure-time-well-spent-with-reporter.html</guid><description>Measure &amp;lsquo;time well spent&amp;rsquo; with reporter?

Se &amp;ldquo;The Iron Law of social intervention&amp;rdquo; fra Gwern.
Broadening interventions for high-risk groups to the entire population is not cost-effective.
What do we mean by &amp;ldquo;primordial interventions&amp;rdquo;?
Since evidence tends to be created where it&amp;rsquo;s easiest to demonstrate benefit, it is likely that systemic benefits are being under-examined, ie. that there are relatively low-hanging fruit.
Why is this the case? Lack of government funding due to cost/risk, and a desire to implement right after pilot studies.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/oit-is-about-cognitions-not-emotions.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/oit-is-about-cognitions-not-emotions.html</guid><description>OIT is about cognitions, not emotions OIT is at the cognitive level; it’s about why we believe we undertake a given action.

Conflicts arise when there are two systems with competing reference conditions - e.g. relax and be productive, or turn up the heat while keeping the room cool. Or be an attentive listener to dad while being stimulated intellectually.
These conflicts can’t be resolved by changing how much you do the activity - you can’t be an attentive listener to a boring conversation - they can only be solved by changing 1) the situation or your perception of it, 2) whether you’re in the situation at all, 3) your reference conditions.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/perforeret-ulcus.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/perforeret-ulcus.html</guid><description>Perforeret ulcus Backlinks [[Ulcus]] [[Perforeret ulcus]] [[Addisonkrise (akut binyrebarkinsufficiens)]] QG.

For at prioritere, hvad man skal forstå først, skal vi vide:  Hvad ser vi Hvad er hyppigst Hvad er alvorligst Under “hvad ser vi” skal vi vide, om symptomerne er uafhængige, om de skal ses som mindre grupper, eller om de skal ses som en samlet enhed.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/pitch-which-diagnoses-are-the-different-nss-symptoms-associated-with.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/pitch-which-diagnoses-are-the-different-nss-symptoms-associated-with.html</guid><description>Pitch: Which diagnoses are the different NSS symptoms associated with? The problem Self-reported symptoms in the general population are much different than the symptoms that doctors see in their practice. Only a selected subset of symptoms reach the perceived severity that patients seek medical attention for them.
But many diseases have a prodromal stage where the symptoms are non-specific. Therefore, a non-specific symptom may be associated with a disease that doesn’t typically exhibit that symptom in clinical practice, simply because the symptom isn’t dominant when the disease presents to a doctor.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/pitching-out-corrupts-within.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/pitching-out-corrupts-within.html</guid><description>Pitching out corrupts within What might the second and third order effects of this be for work?

This would mean that MHC in itself is not a phenomenon worth studying in the hospital context, since it is merely a proxy for things we already understand (ie. that the direct effect of MHC-&amp;gt;Medication = 0). Stated differently, MHC doesn&amp;rsquo;t have incremental validity.
Another explanation is that MHC is the result of general process, but that MHC captures &amp;ldquo;residual&amp;rdquo; problems that aren&amp;rsquo;t captured by the current diagnostic system.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/relationship-maintenance-evidence.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/relationship-maintenance-evidence.html</guid><description>Relationship maintenance evidence [file:7A4FA2C9-1230-47D5-A548-085C3714C4AA-1579-0000010FD5B34417/jftr.12205.pdf]

If one approach doesn’t work, try something else.

Do they capture somatic and psychiatric disease (and/or their severity), do they capture functional somatic disorders, or do they capture general ill-being.
If it captures severity, we’d expect that two children with the same diseases but different MHC would have different healthcare outcomes.

If we know just a little bit about the distribution of BP (eg. normal distribution), measuring A gives us information about the mean of BP.

If we have interventions that effectively prevent the outcome from happening, all predictors will trend towards 0.
That is problematic if we don&amp;rsquo;t internalise the causal structure in the healthcare system – i.e. if the only reason we intervened on a variable is because it was predictive.
However, if treatment is merely augmented by prediction (and adapts to learn from the new predictors), extinguishing those as predictors won&amp;rsquo;t result in worse treatment.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-of-memorising-differential-diagnostics.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-of-memorising-differential-diagnostics.html</guid><description>What is the most efficient way of memorising differential diagnostics?

Consists of three stages:
Recognition: Matching the situation to previous information
Recall: Recalling that information and
Execution: Applying the information to solve the problem.
Q. Which three steps are required for succesful [[§Knowledge transfer]]? A. Recognition, Recall and Execution
Q. How does Recognition differ from Recall for [[§Knowledge transfer]]? A. Recognition is identifying that the situation matches information you have stored, Recall is retrieving that information from memory.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/k%C3%B8kkenindretning.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://martbern.github.io/test_garage_door/posts/k%C3%B8kkenindretning.html</guid><description>§Køkkenindretning Køkkenindretning | Få gode råd til indretning af dit køkken
