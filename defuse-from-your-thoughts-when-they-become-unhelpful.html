<p><a href=we-largely-control-how-we-respond-to-thoughts.html>We largely control how we respond to thoughts</a>, and this makes for a massive difference! <a href=thought-and-feeling-control-strategies-can-cause-problems.html>Thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems</a>, but there are alternatives – eg. <a href=cognitive-defusion.html>Cognitive defusion</a> allows us to let the story be while taking action on something we value.</p>
<p>Just like you can put down the newspaper if you think the story isn&rsquo;t giving you anything, so you can let go of your thoughts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Develop the courage to solve those problems that can be solved, the serenity to accept those that can&rsquo;t, and the wisdom to know the difference
So, this &ldquo;letting the story be&rdquo;, what does it mean? It means that the thought is already there, whether you like it or not, and struggling with it takes up your time and energy without giving you benefit. You might as well accept it to free up energy for activities that provide a meaningful life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wanting to get rid of the thoughts is completely normal! But you don&rsquo;t have to struggle with them; you can want to be rid of them without actively fighting them, just like you can want a project to be complete without worrying that it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>When you start from a place of acceptance, you can be far more effective in your action. You know what is happening around you, rather than your stories.</p>
<p>What if the story is true? Truly, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. [[Thoughts are important if they&rsquo;re helpful]], not because they&rsquo;re true.</p>
<p>Thoughts that are helpful at some point may become problems in the future, so [[Don&rsquo;t hold any thoughts too tightly]].</p>
<p>Applying these techniques won&rsquo;t necessarily make us feel better. But they do make us more likely to take action to live a meaningful life. This is important to remember, you want to use defusion strategies to allow you to take better action – any potential emotional benefit is a side-effect. It&rsquo;s not about controlling your thoughts or emotions, since <a href=thought-and-feeling-control-strategies-can-cause-problems.html>Thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems</a>.</p>
<p>And lastly, <a href=connect-with-the-present-moment-to-enjoy-it-fully.html>Connect with the present moment to enjoy it fully</a>.</p>
<p>To practice this for thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bring to mind a negative self-judgement that commonly bothers you when it comes up, for example, ‘I’m such an idiot.’ Now hold that thought in your mind and really believe it as much as you can for about ten seconds. Notice how it affects you.&mdash;Now imagine taking that same thought and singing it to yourself to the tune of ‘Happy Birthday’. Sing it silently inside your head. Notice what happens.&mdash;Now go back to the thought in its original form. Once again, hold it in your mind and believe it as much as you can, for about ten seconds. Notice how it affects you.&mdash;Now imagine taking that thought and singing it to the tune of ‘Jingle Bells’. Sing it silently inside your head. Notice what happens.
After doing an exercise, you&rsquo;ll probably find that you don&rsquo;t hold the thought to be truth anymore. Notice also that you haven&rsquo;t challenged it at all – not tried to argue with it or replace it, just defused it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are separate techniques for images, see Cp. 8 in the book.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;ll work easily, sometimes it wont work at all – play around with it.</p>
